$n$ = 25 , $p$ = 0.1

### a. At least five cars are black.

$P(x≥5)$ = 1 - $P(x≤4)$ = 1 - 0.902 = 0.098

### c. More than four cars are black.

$P(x>4)$ = 1 - $P(x≤4)$ = 1 - 0.902 = 0.098

### d. Exactly four cars are black.

$P(x=4)$ = $P(x≤4)$ - $P(x≤3)$ = 0.902 - 0.764 = 0.138

### e. Between three and five cars (inclusive) are black.

$P(3≤x≤5)$ = $P(x≤5)$ - $P(x≤2)$ = 0967 - 0.537 = 0.43
