**a. The expected number of years of patent life**\
$\mu = \sum \left[ x_i \cdot p(x_i) \right]$

Where:
- $x_i$ represents each possible value of the random variable.
- $p(x_i)$ represents the corresponding probability of that value.
The expected number of years of patent life for a new drug (the mean) is approximately **7.9** years.

**b. The standard deviation of x**\
$\sigma^2 = \sum \left[ (x_i - \mu)^2 \cdot p(x_i) \right]$

Here’s what happens:

- For each value $x_i$, subtract the expected value $\mu$ to get the deviation of each value from the mean.
- Square each deviation to remove negative signs.
- Multiply each squared deviation by the corresponding probability $p(x_i)$.
- Sum all these values to get the variance $\sigma^2$.

Find the standard deviation: The standard deviation $\sigma$ is simply the square root of the variance:

1. Expected value (mean): From the calculation above, we found the expected value $\mu = 7.9$.

2. Variance: To calculate the variance, we compute:

$\sigma^2 = \sum \left[ (x_i - 7.9)^2 \cdot p(x_i) \right]$

3. Sum these values

$\sigma^2 = 0.7203 + 0.7605 + 0.5887 + 0.3610 + 0.1134 + 0.0020 + 0.2178 + 0.5292 + 0.6727 + 0.5043 + 0.2601
          =4.7299$

Thus, the variance $\sigma^2$ is approximately 4.73.\
\
$\sigma = \sqrt{4.73} \approx 2.17$\
\
\
**c. The probability that xx falls into the interval**\
Step 1: Determine the interval $\mu \pm 2\sigma$

We want to find the probability that $x$ (the number of patent years) falls within two standard deviations from the mean. The interval is calculated as:
$\mu - 2\sigma \leq x \leq \mu + 2\sigma$

Substitute the values of $\mu = 7.9$ and $\sigma = 2.17$:
$7.9 - 2(2.17) \leq x \leq 7.9 + 2(2.17)$

This gives:
$7.9 - 4.34 \leq x \leq 7.9 + 4.34$

So, the interval is:
$3.56 \leq x \leq 12.24$

---

Step 2: Identify the values of $x$ that fall within this interval

From the table provided in the question, the possible values of $x$ are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13$.

The values of $x$ that fall within the interval $3.56 \leq x \leq 12.24$ are:

$x = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$

These are all the values of $x$ between 4 and 12, inclusive.

---

Step 3: Sum the probabilities for these values of $x$

Now, sum the probabilities $p(x)$ for these values of $x$ that fall within the interval:

- For $x = 4$, $p(x) = 0.05$
- For $x = 5$, $p(x) = 0.07$
- For $x = 6$, $p(x) = 0.10$
- For $x = 7$, $p(x) = 0.14$
- For $x = 8$, $p(x) = 0.20$
- For $x = 9$, $p(x) = 0.18$
- For $x = 10$, $p(x) = 0.12$
- For $x = 11$, $p(x) = 0.07$
- For $x = 12$, $p(x) = 0.03$

Summing these probabilities:
$0.05 + 0.07 + 0.10 + 0.14 + 0.20 + 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.07 + 0.03 = $**0.96**

---

**Step 4: Interpret the result**

The sum of the probabilities for the values of $x$ that fall within the interval $\mu \pm 2\sigma$ is $0.96$, or 96\%.

This means that there is a 96\%  probability that the actual patent life $x$ will fall within the interval of $\mu \pm 2\sigma$, which is approximately from $3.56$ years to $12.24$ years.
