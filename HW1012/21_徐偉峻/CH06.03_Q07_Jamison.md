Using the Normal Approximation: Find the mean and standard deviation for the binomial random variable x.

P(20 < x < 25) when n = 100 and p = .2

Then use the correction for the continuity and approximate the probabilities using the normal approximation.

X ~ Binomial (n =100, p = .2)

When n is large, and p is not too close to zero or one, areas under the normal curve with mean np and variance npq can be used to approximate binominal probabilities:

$Binominal(n,p) \approx N(\mu = np, \sigma^2 = npq)$

P(20 < x < 25) 

np = 20 and nq = n(1-p) = 80
$\mu = np = 20$ and $\sigma^2 = npq = 16$
