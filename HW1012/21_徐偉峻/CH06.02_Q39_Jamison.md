$\mu = 1.2$ and $\sigma = .15$. Find P(1.00 < x < 1.10) 


Standardize each value of x by expressing it as a z-score, the umber of standard deviations $\mu$ it lies from the mean $\sigma$.

$z = \frac {x - \mu}{\sigma}$


P(1.00 < x < 1.10) 

$P(\frac{1.00 - 1.2}{.15}  < z <  \frac{1.10 - 1.2}{.15})$
