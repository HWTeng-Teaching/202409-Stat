Earth Day: A USA Today snapshot found that 47% of Americans associate "recycling" with Earth Day.
Suppose a random sample of n = 50 adults are polled and that the 47% figure is correct. Use the normal curve to approximate the probabilities of the following events.

X ~ Binomial (n = 50, p = .47), X = 1, 2, 3, ... 50

When n is large, and p is not too close to zero or one, areas under the normal curve with mean np and variance npq can be used to approximate binominal probabilities:

$Binominal(n,p) \approx N(\mu = np, \sigma^2 = npq)$

Normal Approximation:
1. n =50, p = .47
2. np = 23.5 and nq = n(1-p) = 26.5, np >5 and nq >5
3. $\mu = np = 23.5$ and $\sigma^2 = npq = 12.455$
4. P( x < 30 ), P(x > 20), P(x < 40) 
5. Continuity corrct for x, P( x < 29.5 ), P(x > 20.5), P(x < 39.5) 
6. Convert the necessary x-values to z-values

a. Fewer than 30 individuals associate "recycling" with Earth Day?  
  
  $z = \frac{x \pm 0.5 - np}{\sqrt{npq}}$, 
$P(z < \frac{29.5 - 23.5}{3.5292} )$

= P (z < 1.7001) = 



b. More than 20 individuals associate "recycling" with Earth Day?

c. More than 10 individuals do not associate "recycling" with Earth Day?
