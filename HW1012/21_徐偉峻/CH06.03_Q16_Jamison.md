Earth Day: A USA Today snapshot found that 47% of Americans associate "recycling" with Earth Day.
Suppose a random sample of n = 50 adults are polled and that the 47% figure is correct. Use the normal curve to approximate the probabilities of the following events.

X ~ Binomial (n = 50, p = .47), X = 1, 2, 3, ... 50

When n is large, and p is not too close to zero or one, areas under the normal curve with mean np and variance npq can be used to approximate binominal probabilities:

$Binominal(n,p) \approx N(\mu = np, \sigma^2 = npq)$

Normal Approximation:
1. n =50, p = .47
2. np = 20 and nq = n(1-p) = 80, np >5 and nq >5
3. $\mu = np = 20$ and $\sigma^2 = npq = 16$
4. P(20 < x < 25)
5. Continuity corrct for x, P(20.5 < x < 24.5)
6. Convert the necessary x-values to z-values
  $z = \frac{x \pm 0.5 - np}{\sqrt{npq}}$, 
$P\left(\frac{20.5 - 20}{4} < z < \frac{24.5 - 20}{4}\right)$

= P (0.125 < z < 1.125) = 0.8697 - 0.5498 = 0.3199



a. Fewer than 30 individuals associate "recycling" with Earth Day?

b. More than 20 individuals associate "recycling" with Earth Day?

c. More than 10 individuals do not associate "recycling" with Earth Day?
