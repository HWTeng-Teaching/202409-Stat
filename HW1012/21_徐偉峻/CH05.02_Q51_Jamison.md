Car colors: Car color preferences change over the years and accordiung to the particular model thay customer selects.
In a recent year, suppose that 10% of all luxurt cars sold were black. If 25 cars of that year and type are randomly selected, find the following probabilities:

a. At least five cars are black

p(x &ge; 5) n = 25, p = .1

Equal to 1 - p(x &le; 4) = 1 - 0.902 = 0.098

b. At most six cars are black.
p(x &le; 6) = 0.991

c. More than four cars are black.

p(x &gt; 4) equal to 1 - p (x &le; 4) = 1 - 0.902 = 0.098

d. Exactly four cars are black.

p(x=4) = p(x &le; 4) - p( x &le; 3) = 0.902 - 0.764 = 0.138

e. Between three and five cars (inclusive) are black.

p(3 &le; x &le; 5) = p(x &le; 6) - p(x &le; 2) = 0.991 - 0.537 =
