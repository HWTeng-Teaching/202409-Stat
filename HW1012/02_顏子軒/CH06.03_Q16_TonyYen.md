***Earth Day***

***USA Today snapshot found that 47% of Americans associate ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù with Earth Day.9 Suppose a random sample of n=50 adults are polled and that the 47% figure is correct. Use the normal curve to approximate the probabilities of the following events.***

***a. Fewer than 30 individuals associate ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù with Earth Day?***

>**Step 1: Identify key values**
>
>- Sample size $n = 50$
>- Probability of success ùëù=0.47
>- Find $P(X<30)$
><br/>
>
>**Step 2: Find the mean and standard deviation**
>
>For a binomial distribution:
>- mean $\mu = n \times p = 50 \times 0.47 = 23.5
>- standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{n \times p \times (1-p)} = \sqrt{50 \times 0.47 \times 0.53} \approx 3.53$
>
><br/>
>
>**Step 3: Apply the correction for continuity**
>
>Since we are using a normal approximation, we apply the correction for continuity, $P(X < 29.5)$
>
><br/>
>
>**Step 4: Convert to a z-score**
>
>$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{29.5-23.5}{3.53} \approx 1.7$
>
><br/>
>
>**Step 5: Find the probability using the standard normal distribution**
>
>Using a standard normal table, $P(z < 1.7) \approx 0.9554$
>
>Thus, the probability that fewer than 30 individuals in a sample of 50 associate "recycling" with Earth Day is approximately 0.9554(or about 95.54%)

***b. More than 20 individuals associate ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù with Earth Day?***

>**Step 1: Identify key values**
>
>- $n = 50$
>- $p = 0.47$
>- Find $P(X > 20)$
>

>
>**Step 2: Find the mean and standard deviation**
>
>- mean $\mu = n \times p = 50 \times 0.47 = 23.5
>- standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{n \times p \times (1-p)} = \sqrt{50 \times 0.47 \times 0.53} \approx 3.53$

>
>**Step 3: Apply the correction for continuity**
>
>$P(X > 20.5)$ = 1 - $P(X \leq 20.5)$ 
>
><br/>
>
>**Step 4: Convert to a z-score**
>
>$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{20.5-23.5}{3.53} \approx -0.85$
>
><br/>
>
>**Step 5: Find the probability using the standard normal distribution**
>
>Using a standard normal table, $P(z < -0.85)$ = 0.1977
>
>$P(X > 20.5)$ = 1 - $P(X \leq 20.5)$ $= 1 - 0.1977 = 0.8023$
>
>Thus, the probability that fewer than 30 individuals in a sample of 50 associate "recycling" with Earth Day is approximately 0.8023 (or about 80.23%)

***c. More than 10 individuals do not associate ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù with Earth Day?***
