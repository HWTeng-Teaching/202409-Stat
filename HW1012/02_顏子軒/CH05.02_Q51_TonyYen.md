***a. At least five cars are black.***

>$P(x \geq 5)$ = 1-0.902(found by looking up the table) = 0.098

***b. At most six cars are black.***

>$P(x \leq 6)$ = 0.991(found by looking up the table)

***c. More than four cars are black.***

>$P(x > 4)$ = 1 - $P(x \leq 4)$= 1 - 0.902(found by looking up the table) = 0.098

***d. Exactly four cars are black.***

***e. Between three and five cars (inclusive) are black.***

***f. More than 20 cars are not black.***
