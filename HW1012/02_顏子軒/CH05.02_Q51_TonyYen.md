***Car Colors***

***Car color preferences change over the years and according to the particular model that the customer selects. In a recent year, suppose that 10% of all luxury cars sold were black. If 25 cars of that year and type are randomly selected, find the following probabilities:***

***a. At least five cars are black.***

>$P(x \geq 5)$ = 1-0.902(found by looking up the table) = 0.098

***b. At most six cars are black.***

>$P(x \leq 6)$ = 0.991(found by looking up the table)

***c. More than four cars are black.***

>$P(x > 4)$ = 1 - $P(x \leq 4)$= 1 - 0.902(found by looking up the table) = 0.098

***d. Exactly four cars are black.***

>$P(x = 4)$ = $P(x \leq 4)$ - $P(x \leq 3)$ = 0.902-0.764(found by looking up the table) = 0.138

***e. Between three and five cars (inclusive) are black.***

>$P(3 \leq x \leq 5)$ = $P(x \leq 5)$ - $P( x \leq 2)$ = 0.967-0.537(found by looking up the table) = 0.43

***f. More than 20 cars are not black.***

>$P( x \leq 4)$ = 0.902(found by looking up the table)
