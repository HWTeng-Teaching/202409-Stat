***Human Heights***

**Assume that the heights of American men are normally distributed with a mean of 176.5 centimeters and a standard deviation of 8.9 centimeters. Use this information to answer the questions in Exercises 49–52.**

**51. President Donald Trump is 1.88 m. Is this an unusual height?**

>$\mu = 176.5$
>
>$\sigma = 8.9$
>
>$X = 188$
>
>$z-score = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{188-176.5}{8.9} \approx 1.29$
>
><br/>
>A z-score of 1.29 means Trump's height is approximately 1.29 standard deviations above the average height.
>
>Generally, a z-score is considered "unusual" if it is less than −2 or greater than 2, meaning more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.
>
>Since Trump's z-score is only 1.29, his height is not considered unusual based on the distribution of heights for American men. It is above average but still within the normal range.
