***23. A Pair of Dice***

***Toss a pair of dice and record x, the sum of the numbers on the two upper faces.***

>When tossing a pair of dice, the possible sums of the numbers on the two upper faces (denoted as 𝑥) range from 2 to 12. The probability distribution for the sum is not uniform since some sums have more possible combinations of dice values than others.
>We will count how many ways each possible sum 𝑥 can occur. The total number of outcomes when tossing two dice is $6\times 6 = 36$
