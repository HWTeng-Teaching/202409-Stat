***The maximum patent life for a new drug is 17 years. Subtracting the length of time required by the FDA for testing and approval of the drug provides the actual patent life of the drugâ€”that is, the length of time that a company has to recover research and development costs and make a profit.

***a. Find the expected number of years of patent life for a new drug.***

***b. Find the standard deviation of x.***

***c. Find the probability that x falls into the interval $\mu +- 2\sigma$***
