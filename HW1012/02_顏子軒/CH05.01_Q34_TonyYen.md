***FDA Testing***

***The maximum patent life for a new drug is 17 years. Subtracting the length of time required by the FDA for testing and approval of the drug provides the actual patent life of the drugâ€”that is, the length of time that a company has to recover research and development costs and make a profit.

**a. Find the expected number of years of patent life for a new drug.**

>mean $\mu = \sum xp(x) = 7.9$

**b. Find the standard deviation of x.**

> standard deviation = 

**c. Find the probability that x falls into the interval $\mu +- 2\sigma$**
