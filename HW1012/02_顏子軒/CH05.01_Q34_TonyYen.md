***FDA Testing***

***The maximum patent life for a new drug is 17 years. Subtracting the length of time required by the FDA for testing and approval of the drug provides the actual patent life of the drugâ€”that is, the length of time that a company has to recover research and development costs and make a profit. Suppose the distribution of the lengths of patent life for new drugs is as shown here:***

**b. Find the standard deviation of x.**

> standard deviation = $\sqrt {\sigma^2} =\sqrt {4.73} \approx2.17$ 

**c. Find the probability that x falls into the interval $\mu +- 2\sigma$**

>Find $P(\mu - 2\sigma < x < \mu + 2\sigma )$ = $P(3.56 < x < 12.24 )$
