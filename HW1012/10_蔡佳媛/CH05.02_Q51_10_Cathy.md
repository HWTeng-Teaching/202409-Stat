售出的豪華車中有10%為黑色，隨機售出的25台車出現下列各情形的機率:

### a. At least 5 cars are black

$Binomial(n=25, p=0.1), x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25$

$p(x \geq 5), n=25, p=0.1 = 1 - p(x \leq 4) = 1 - 0.902 = 0.098$

### b. At most 6 cars are black

$p(x \leq 6), n=25, p=0.1 = 0.991$

### c. More than 4 cars are black

$p(x \gt 4) = 1 - p(x \leq 3) = 1 - 0.764 = 0.236$

### d. Exactly 4 cars are black

$p(x = 4) = p(x \leq 4) - p(x \leq 3) = 0.902 - 0.764 = 0.138$

### e. Between 3 and 5 cars (inclusive) are black





### f. More than 20 cars are not black
