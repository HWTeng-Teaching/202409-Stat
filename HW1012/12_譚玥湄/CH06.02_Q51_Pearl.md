Q51 : Human Heights Assume that the heights of American men are normally distributed with a mean of 176.5 centimeters 
and a standard deviation of 8.9 centimeters. Use this information to answer the questions .  

51. President Donald Trump is 1.88 m. Is this an unusual height?  
Answer :  
解題重點轉換成 z-score  
- X=188  , μ=176.5 ,  s= standard deviation   
- P((x-μ)/s)  = (188-176.5)/8.9) = 1.29  
- P(z >= 1.29) , 查表得知 P(z >=1.29) = 0.0985

  故 P(x > 188) = 0.0985 , it's not an unusual height
