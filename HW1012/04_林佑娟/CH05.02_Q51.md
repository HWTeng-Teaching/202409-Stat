解答
a. At least five cars are black.
  n = 20, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x>=5) = 1 - Ｐ(x<=4) 

b. At most six cars are black.
  n = 20, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x<=6) = 

c. More than four cars are black.
  n = 20, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x>=5) = 1 - Ｐ(x<=4)

d. Exactly four cars are black.
  n = 20, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x=4) = Ｐ(x=4)-Ｐ(x<=4)

e. Between three and five cars (inclusive) are black. f. More than 20 cars are not black.
  n = 20, p =0.1 , Ｐ(3<x<5) = Ｐ(x<=4) - Ｐ(x<3)

f. More than 20 cars are not black.
