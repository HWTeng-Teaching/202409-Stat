解答
a. At least five cars are black.
  n = 25, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x>=5) = 1 - Ｐ(x<=4) = 1-0.902 = 0.098

b. At most six cars are black.
  n = 25, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x<=6) = 0.991 

c. More than four cars are black.
  n = 25, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x>=5) = 1 - Ｐ(x<=4) = 1-0.902 = 0.098

d. Exactly four cars are black.
  n = 25, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x=4) = Ｐ(x=4)-Ｐ(x<=3) = 0.902 - 0.764 = 0.138

e. Between three and five cars (inclusive) are black. f. More than 20 cars are not black.
  n = 25, p =0.1 , Ｐ(3<=x<=5) = Ｐ(x<=4) - Ｐ(x<=2) = 0.967 - 0.537 = 0.43

f. More than 20 cars are not black.
  n = 25, p =0.1 , Ｐ(x>=20) = 1 -Ｐ(x<=19) = 1 - 1 = 0
