以下查表得

a.

P(x<12) for n = 20, p = .5

P(x<12) = P(x &le; 11) = 0.748

b.

P(x &le; 6) for n = 15, p = .4

P(x &le; 6) = 0.610

c.

P(x>4) for n = 10, p = .4

P(x>4) = P(x &le; 4) = 1 - 0.633 = 0.367

d.

P(x &ge; 6) = for n = 15, p = .6

P(x &ge; 6) = P(x &le; 5) = 1 - 0.034 = 0.966

e.

P(3<x<7) for n = 10, p = .5

P(3<x<7) ＝ P(x &le; 6) - P(x &le; 3) = 0.828 - 0.172 = 0.656
