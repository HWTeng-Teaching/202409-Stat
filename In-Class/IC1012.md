1. A marksman hits a target 80% of the
time. He fires five shots at the target. Let $X$ denote the of shots hit the target. 


a) What is the distribution of $X$?

b) What is the probability that exactly 3 shots hit the target?


c) Write down the probability mass function of $X$. 

d) Find the $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ of $X$. 

e) Calculate $P(X\leq 2)$.
