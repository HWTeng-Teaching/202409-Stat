## Question 1 

 A marksman hits a target 80% of the
time. He fires five shots at the target. Let $X$ denote the of shots hit the target. 


a) What is the distribution of $X$?

b) Write down the probability mass function of $X$. 

c) What is the probability that exactly 3 shots hit the target?


d) Find the $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ of $X$. 

e) Calculate $P(X\leq 2)$.

## Question 2
Assume toss a fair coin 25 times. Is it unsual to observe lesws than or equal to 8 heads? 
Let $X$ be the number of heads in this 25 draws. 

a) What is the distribution of $X$?

b) Please calculate $P(X\leq 8)$ using table I. 

c) Please approximate $P(X\leq 8)$ using Z-score normalization.
