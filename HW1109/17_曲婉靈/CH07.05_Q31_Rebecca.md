## a.

Yes, the distribution of $\hat{p}$ has an aprroximate normal distribution because the number of sample is over 30.  
mean = 0.47  
deviation = $\sqrt{0.47*0.53/100} \approx$  0.05

## b.

P ( $\hat{p}$ < 0.45) = P ( Z < -0.4 ) = 0.3446

## c.

P ( 0.42 < $\hat{p}$ < 0.45) = P( -1 < Z < 0.4) = P( Z < -0.4) - P ( Z < -1) = 0.3446-0.1587 = 0.1859

## d.

1. The null hypothesis p = 0.47 may not be true

2. The actual proportion p may be significantly lower than 0.47

If further evaluation is required, more sampling is needed for confirmation.
