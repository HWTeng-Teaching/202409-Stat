If the sample is normal, then the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ will be also normal, no matter what the sample size.

And $\bar{x_n}$ has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

## a.

We know $\bar{x_n}$ has mean $\mu$ = 422 then 3 bananas would be 422x3 = 1266  
deviation = 3x $\frac{13}{\sqrt{3}} \approx$ 22.5167 

## b.

totally over 1300mg
P( x > 1300 ) = P( Z > $\frac{1300-1266}{22.5167}$ ) =P( Z > 1.51 ) = 1 - P( Z < 1.51 ) = 1 -0.9345 = 0.0655
