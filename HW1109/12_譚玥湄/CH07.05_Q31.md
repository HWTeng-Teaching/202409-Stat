Eco-Friendly A USA Today snapshot found that  47% of Americans associate “recycling” with Earth
Day.14 Suppose a random sample of n5100 adults are  polled and the 47% figure is correct.
a. Does the distribution of ˆp, the sample proportion of Americans who associate “recycling” with Earth  
Day, have an approximate normal distribution? If so, what is its mean and standard deviation?  
b. What is the probability that the sample proportion ˆp is less than 0.45?  
c. What is the probability that ˆp lies in the interval .42 to .45?  
d. What might you conclude about p if the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30?
