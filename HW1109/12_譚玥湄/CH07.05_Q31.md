Eco-Friendly A USA Today snapshot found that  47% of Americans associate “recycling” with Earth
Day.14 Suppose a random sample of n=100 adults are  polled and the 47% figure is correct.

Given:
Population proportion (𝑝): 0.47
Sample size (𝑛=100)

a. Does the distribution of ˆp, the sample proportion of Americans who associate “recycling” with Earth  
Day, have an approximate normal distribution? If so, what is its mean and standard deviation?  

The sampling distribution of $$\hat{p}$$  is approximately normal if the conditions n⋅p≥10  and n⋅(1−p)≥10 are satisfied.

Check Conditions:
- n⋅p=5100⋅0.47=2397(≥10)
- n⋅(1−p)=5100⋅(1−0.47)=5100⋅0.53=2703(≥10)

The mean of $$\hat{p}$$ is:  
$$\mu_{\hat{p}} = p = 0.47$$ 

The standard deviation of $$\hat{p}$$ is:  
$$σ\hat{p}$$ = $$\sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}$$  
$$σ\hat{p}$$ = $$\sqrt{\frac{0.47(1 - 0.47)}{5100}}$$  = $$\sqrt{0.00004884} \approx 0.00699$$  

Thus:  
μ$$\hat{p}$$=0.47, $$σ\hat{p}$$≈0.00699

b. What is the probability that the sample proportion $$\hat{p}$$ is less than 0.45?  
Standardize $$\hat{p}$$=0.45 and using the Z-score formula:  
$$Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \mu_{\hat{p}}}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}$$  
$$Z = \frac{0.45 - 0.47}{0.00699} = \frac{-0.02}{0.00699} \approx  -2.86$$  
Using the standard normal table:  
$$P(Z < -2.86) \approx 0.0021  
Thus:  
P($$\hat{p}$$<0.45)≈0.0021 or 0.21%.  

---
c. What is the probability that ˆp lies in the interval .42 to .45?  
Find the Z-scores for $$\hat{p}$$ =0.42 and $$\hat{p}$$=0.45.  

For $$\hat{p}$$ = 0.42:    
$$Z = \frac{0.42 - 0.47}{0.00699} = \frac{-0.05}{0.00699} \approx -7.15  $$

From the Z-table:
P(Z<−7.15)≈0(essentially zero probability)

For $$\hat{p}$$ = 0.45:  
$$Z = \frac{0.45 - 0.47}{0.00699} = \frac{-0.02}{0.00699} \approx -2.86Z=0.006990.45−0.47=0.00699−0.02≈−2.86 $$

From the Z-table:
$$ P(Z < -2.86) \approx 0.0021 $$  

Thus, the probability that $$\hat{p}$$ lies in the interva 0.42 to 0.45 is approximately:  
P(0.42< $$\hat{p}$$ <0.45)≈P(Z=−2.86)−P(Z=−7.15)=0.0021−0≈0.0021 or 0.21%.

---
d. What might you conclude about p if the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30?  
If the observed sample proportion $$\hat{p}$$<0.30 we compare this to the expected distribution under p=0.47:   

Find the Z-score for $$\hat{p}$$=0.30:  
$$Z = \frac{0.30 - 0.47}{0.00699} = \frac{-0.17}{0.00699} \approx -24.32Z=0.006990.30−0.47=0.00699−0.17≈−24.32$$

A Z-score of −24.32 is astronomically low. The probability of observing such a sample proportion under the assumption that p=0.47 is effectively zero: P(Z<−24.32)≈0  

This suggests that the true population proportion ppp is likely much lower than 0.47, as the observed sample proportion $$\hat{p}$$ < 0.30 is highly inconsistent with the assumption p=0.47. This would lead us to question or reject the hypothesis that p=0.47.
