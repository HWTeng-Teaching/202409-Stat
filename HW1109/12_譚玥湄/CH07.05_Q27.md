Tossing Coins A fair coin is tossed n = 80 times. Let ˆp be the sample proportion of heads.  
Find P(.44 , $\hat{p}$ , .61).

---
Step 1: Identify the mean and standard deviation of $$\hat{p}$$  
For a fair coin:  
•	Population proportion (p): 0.5  
•	Sample size (n): 80  

The standard deviation of $\hat{p}$ is given by:  
•	 $$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}$  

•	 $$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1 - 0.5)}{80}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.25}{80}} = \sqrt{0.003125} \approx 0.0559$$
  
•	 $${\hat{p}} = 0.5,μp^=0.5,σp^≈0.0559 $$
