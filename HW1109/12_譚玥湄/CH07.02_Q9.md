CH07.02_Q9
A population consists of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m = 17. 
A random sample of n= 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. 

9. Find the mean of x for each of the distributions in Exercises 7 and 8.
How do they compare with the population mean of m =17?

1. Sampling Without Replacement  
•	Sample means: 12.5,15.5,16,18,18.5,21.5  
•	Probabilities: P($$\overline{x}$$)=17≈0.167  
•	$$μ\overline{x}$$=(12.5⋅0.167)+(15.5⋅0.167)+(16⋅0.167)+(18⋅0.167)+(18.5⋅0.167)+(21.5⋅0.167)

2. Sampling With Replacement  
•	Sample means: 10,12.5,15,15.5,16,18,18.5,21,21.5,22  
•	Probabilities: P($$\overline{x}$$)= frequency /  16
