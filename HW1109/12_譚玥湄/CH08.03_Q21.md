CH08.03_Q21  
Changing the Confidence Levels A random sample of n=100 measurements has been selected from a  
population with unknown mean m and known standard deviation s =10. Calculate the width of the confidence  
interval for m for the confidence levels given in Exercises 21â€“23.   
What effect do the changing confidence levels have on the width of the interval?  
21. 99%(a =.01)  
22. 95%(a =.05)  
23. 90%(a =.10)  

---
mean = unknown , s = 10  , n=100  
21. confidence level =99% , zscore $$z_{0.005}$$ = 2.58  
    width of the interval = 2.58 * 2 = 5.16

22. confidence level =95% , z score $$z_{0.025}$$= 1.96  
    width of the interval = 1.95 * 2 = 3.92    

22. confidence level =90% , z score  $$z_{0.05}$$ = 1.645  
    width of the interval = 1.645 * 2 = 3.29
