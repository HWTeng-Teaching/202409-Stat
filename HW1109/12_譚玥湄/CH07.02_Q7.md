CH07.02_Q7

A population consists of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m = 17. 
A random sample of n= 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. 

7. How many possible random samples are there when sampling without replacement? List the possible samples.
Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean x and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.

Step1 . List the Possible Samples (without replacement) 
{10,15},{10,21},{10,22},{15,21},{15,22},{21,22}

| Possible samples|   x̄ |      P(x̄) | 
|----------------:|:----:|:----:|
|{10,15}| 12.5 | 1/6=0.167|
|{10,21}|  15.5 | 1/6=0.167|
|{10,22}|  16.0 | 1/6=0.167|
|{15,21}|  18.0 | 1/6=0.167|
|{15,22}|  18.5 | 1/6=0.167|
|{21,22}|  21.5 | 1/6=0.167|
