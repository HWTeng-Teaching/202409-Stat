CH07.02_Q7

A population consists of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m = 17. 
A random sample of n= 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. 

7. How many possible random samples are there when sampling without replacement? List the possible samples.
Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean x and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.
