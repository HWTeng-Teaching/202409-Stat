**Potassium Levels** : The amount of potassium in food  varies, but bananas are often associated with high potassium,
with approximately 422 mg in a medium-sized  banana. Suppose the distribution of potassium in a  banana is normally distributed, with mean equal to
422 mg and standard deviation equal to 13 mg per banana.  You eat n = 3 bananas per day, and T is the total number of milligrams of potassium you receive from them.  
a. Find the mean and standard deviation of T.  
b. Find the probability that your total daily intake of potassium from the three bananas will exceed 1300 mg.

Given Information  
*Mean potassium per banana (μ): 422mg  
*Standard deviation of potassium per banana (σ): 13 mg  
*Number of bananas (n): 3  
*μT = n ⋅ μ  
*T ~  N( 3 * $$\mu$$ , $$\sqrt{3}$$ * $$\sigma $$ )  

-  a. Find the mean and standard deviation of T.  
The mean of the total potassium (T) is given by:  
μ(T)= n ⋅ μ  =  3 * 422 = 1266 ,  
The standard deviation of T is:  σ(T) = n ⋅ σ = 3 ⋅ 13 ≈ 22.52mg  
Thus, T follows a normal distribution:  T∼N(1266, 22.5167)

- b. Find the probability that your total daily intake of potassium from the three bananas will exceed 1300 mg.  
The standard deviation of T is:  
$$Z = \frac{T - \mu_T}{\sigma_T}$$  
T=1300 into the Z-score formula:  $$Z = \frac{1300 - 1266}{22.52}  \approx 1.51 $$  
Then use a standard normal distribution table to find P(Z>1.51), which would be approximately 0.0655 or 6.55%.
