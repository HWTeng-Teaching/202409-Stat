Potassium Levels The amount of potassium in food  varies, but bananas are often associated with high potassium,
with approximately 422 mg in a medium-sized  banana.8 Suppose the distribution of potassium in a  banana is normally distributed, with mean equal to
422 mg and standard deviation equal to 13 mg per banana. You eat n53 bananas per day, and T is the total number of milligrams of potassium you receive from them.  
a. Find the mean and standard deviation of T.  
b. Find the probability that your total daily intake of potassium from the three bananas will exceed 1300 mg.
