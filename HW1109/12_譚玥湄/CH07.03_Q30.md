Potassium Levels The amount of potassium in food  varies, but bananas are often associated with high potassium,
with approximately 422 mg in a medium-sized  banana. Suppose the distribution of potassium in a  banana is normally distributed, with mean equal to
422 mg and standard deviation equal to 13 mg per banana. You eat n53 bananas per day, and T is the total number of milligrams of potassium you receive from them.

Given Information  
•	Mean potassium per banana (μ): 422mg  
•	Standard deviation of potassium per banana (σ): 13 mg  
•	Number of bananas (n): 53

a. Find the mean and standard deviation of T.  
The mean of the total potassium (T) is given by:  
μT=n⋅μ => 53 * 422=22,366mg$$

The standard deviation of T is:  
σT=n⋅σ=3⋅13≈22.52mg  

Thus, T follows a normal distribution:  
T∼N(1266, $${22.52^2}$$)T

b. Find the probability that your total daily intake of potassium from the three bananas will exceed 1300 mg.  
The standard deviation of T is:  
$$Z = \frac{T - \mu_T}{\sigma_T}$$  

T=1300 into the Z-score formula:  
$$Z = \frac{1300 - 1266}{22.52}  \approx 1.51 $$  
Then use a standard normal distribution table to find P(Z>1.51), which would be approximately 0.0655 or 6.55%.
