CH07.05_Q28 Canada! 
The National Hockey League has approximately 70% of its players born outside the United States. 
In a random sample of n=50 NHL players, what is the probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the United States exceeds 80%?

---
To solve this problem, we determine the probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the United States ($$\hat{p}$$) exceeds 80% ($$\hat{p}$$ > 0.8).

Step 1: Identify the parameters  
•	Population proportion (p): 0.7  
•	Sample size (n): 50  

The sampling distribution of the sample proportion  
$$\hat{p}$$ is approximately normal if n⋅p≥10n \cdot p \geq 10n⋅p≥10 and n⋅(1−p)≥10n \cdot (1-p) \geq 10n⋅(1−p)≥10, which holds here:
n⋅p=50⋅0.7=35,n⋅(1−p)=50⋅0.3=15n \cdot p = 50 \cdot 0.7 = 35, \quad n \cdot (1-p) = 50 \cdot 0.3 = 15n⋅p=50⋅0.7=35,n⋅(1−p)=50⋅0.3=15
Mean of $$\hat{p}$$:
μp^=p=0.7\mu_{\hat{p}} = p = 0.7μp^=p=0.7
Standard deviation of $$\hat{p}$$:
σp^=p(1−p)n=0.7(1−0.7)50=0.2150≈0.0648\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.7(1-0.7)}{50}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.21}{50}} \approx 0.0648σp^=np(1−p)=500.7(1−0.7)=500.21≈0.0648

Step 2: Standardize the sample proportion
To calculate P($$\hat{p}$$ > 0.8)P(p^>0.8), we find the Z-score for p^=0.8\hat{p} = 0.8p^=0.8:
Z=p^−μp^σp^Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \mu_{\hat{p}}}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}Z=σp^p^−μp^ Z=0.8−0.70.0648≈0.10.0648≈1.54Z = \frac{0.8 - 0.7}{0.0648} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.0648} \approx 1.54Z=0.06480.8−0.7≈0.06480.1≈1.54

Step 3: Find the probability
Using the standard normal table or a calculator:
P(Z>1.54)=1−P(Z<1.54) P(Z > 1.54) = 1 - P(Z < 1.54)P(Z>1.54)=1−P(Z<1.54)
From the Z-table:
P(Z<1.54)≈0.9382P(Z < 1.54) \approx 0.9382P(Z<1.54)≈0.9382
So:
P(Z>1.54)=1−0.9382=0.0618P(Z > 1.54) = 1 - 0.9382 = 0.0618P(Z>1.54)=1−0.9382=0.0618

Final Answer
The probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the United States exceeds 80% is:  
P($$\hat{p}$$ > 0.8) \approx 0.0618 or 6.18%.
