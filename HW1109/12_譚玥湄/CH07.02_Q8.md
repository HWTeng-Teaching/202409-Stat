CH07.02_Q8  
A population consists of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m = 17. 
A random sample of n= 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. 

How many possible random samples are available when sampling with replacement?  
List the possible samples. Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean x and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.

-----
Step 1 . List the Possible Samples (with replacement)  
n*m = 4^2 =16  
{10,10},{10,15},{10,21},{10,22},  
{15,10},{15,15},{15,21},{15,22},  
{21,10},{21,15},{21,21},{21,22},  
{22,10},{22,15},{22,21},{22,22} 

Step 2 . Display sampling distribution as a table
| Possible samples|   x̄ |      P(x̄) | 
|----------------:|:----:|:----:|
|{10,10}| 10 | 1/16=0.0625|
|{10,15}| 12.5 | 2/16=0.125|
|{10,21}| 15.5 | 2/16=0.125|
|{10,22}| 16 | 2/16=0.125|
|{15,15}| 15 | 1/16=0.0625|
|{15,21}| 18 | 2/16=0.125|
|{15,22}| 18.5 | 2/16=0.125|
|{21,21}| 21 | 1/16=0.0625|
|{21,22}| 21.5| 2/16=0.125|
|{22,22}| 22| 1/16=0.0625|

Step 3 . Display sampling distribution as probability histogram
