CH07.02_Q8  
A population consists of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m = 17. 
A random sample of n= 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. 

How many possible random samples are available when sampling with replacement?  
List the possible samples. Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean x and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.
