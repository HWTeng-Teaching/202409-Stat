Population III A population consists of N 54 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m 517. A random sample
of n52 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. 

How many possible random samples are available when sampling with replacement?  
List the possible samples. Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean x and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.
