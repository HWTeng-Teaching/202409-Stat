Batteries A certain type of automobile battery is known to last an average of 1110 days with a standard deviation of 80 days. 
If 400 of these batteries are selected, find the following probabilities for the average length of life of the selected batteries:  
a. The average is between 1100 and 1110.  
b. The average is greater than 1120.  
c. The average is less than 900.  

---
- Sample mean ($\overline{x}$) =1110 days
- Sample size(n) = 400
- standard deviation(s) = 80

Step 1: Standard error of the mean  
The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated as:  
$$SEM= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$   
$$SEM= \frac{80}{\sqrt{400}} $$   = 4  

Step 2: Standardizing (Z-scores)
For each probability, we calculate the Z-score using the formula:  
Z-scores = $$\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\text{SEM}} $$

use Central limit Therem  
a. The average is between 1100 and 1110.  
For $$\bar{x}$$ =1100 : Z-scores = $$\frac{\bar{1100} - 1110}{\text{4}} $$  = -2.5
For $$\bar{x}$$ =1110 : Z-scores = $$\frac{\bar{1100} - 1110}{\text{4}} $$  = 0
P(-2.5 < z < 0 ) =P(z<0)−P(z<−2.5) = 0.5 − 0.0062= 0.4938 

b. The average is greater than 1120.  
For $$\bar{x}$$ > 1120 : Z-scores = $$\frac{\bar{1120} - 1110}{\text{4}} $$  = 2.5
P(z>2.5)=1−P(z<2.5)  = P(z>2.5) =1−0.9938=0.0062


c. The average is less than 900.  
For $$\bar{x}$$ < 900  : Z-scores = $$\frac{\bar{900} - 1110}{\text{4}} $$  = -52.5
P(z<-52.5 )= 0
