CH08.02_Q26 Recidivism  
An experimental rehabilitation technique was used on released convicts.   
It was shown that 79 of 121 men subjected to the technique pursued useful and crime-free lives for a 3-year period following prison release.  
Find a point estimate for p,  the probability that a convict subjected to the rehabilitation technique will follow a crime-free existence for at least  3 years after prison release.  
Calculate the margin of error.  


---
mean = unknown , s = 10 , n=121 ,  probability = 65.29%  
we can use 95% margin of error when n>=30 is estimated as  
1.96 * \sqrt{(\frac{\hat{p} \hat{1-p}}{n}	)}$$  =1.96 * \sqrt{(\frac{{0.6529} ({0.3471})}{121}	)}$$ = 1.96*0.04327=0.0848
