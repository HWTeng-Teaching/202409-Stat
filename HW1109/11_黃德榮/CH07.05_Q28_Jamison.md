O Canada! The National Hocley Leugue has approximately 70% of its players born outside the United States. In a random sample of n = 50 NHL players, what is the probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the United States exceeds 80%?

Given: 

1. Proportion of plyers born outside the U.S., p = 0.70.
2. Sample size, n = 50.
3. We need to find P($\hat{p} > 0.80$), where ($\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion of players born outside the U.S.

From the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ follows an approximately normal distribution with:

Mean $\mu_{\hat{p}} = p = 0.70$.

Standard deviation: $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = 0.0648$

Z = $\frac{0.80 - 0.70}{0.0648} = 1.54$

$P(\hat{p} > 0.80) = P(Z > 1.54) = 1 - P(Z â‰¤ 1.54) = 1- 0.9382 = 0.0618 $
