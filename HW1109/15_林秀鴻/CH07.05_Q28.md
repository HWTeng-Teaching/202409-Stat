70% of NHL's players born outside the U.S.  
Sample size = n =50  

全國曲棍球聯盟大約有70％球員出生在美國以外的地方，在隨機的N = 50個 NHL 球員的樣本中，

在美國以外出生的球員樣本比例超過80％的可能性是多少？

### What is the probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the U.S. exceeds 80%?

p = the portion of players born outside the U.S. = 0.7  

Sample mean = $\hat{p} = 0.7$
Standard deviation = $\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{50}} = \sqrt{0.0042} \approx 0.0648$  

$P(\hat{p} \gt 0.8) = 1 - P( z \lt \frac{0.8-0.7}{0.0648}) \approx 1 - P( z \lt 1.54) = 1 - 0.9382 = 0.0618$
