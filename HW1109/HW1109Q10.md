recidivism[rɪˈsɪdɪvɪzəm]: 累犯/再犯\
recidivism rate: 累犯率\
rehabilitation: 康復/改過自新

### Given:
- Number of individuals who pursued crime-free lives: x = 79 
- Total number of individuals:  n = 121 

### 1. **Point Estimate for \( p \):**
$\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{79}{121}$\
$\hat{p} = 0.6529 \text{ (approximately } 0.653 \text{)}$

### 2. **Margin of Error:**
The margin of error (ME) is calculated using the formula for a confidence interval for a proportion:
$ME = Z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}$
Where:
- Z : Critical value for the desired confidence level (e.g., for 95% confidence, \( Z = 1.96 \).
- $\hat{p}$: Sample proportion.
- n : Sample size.

PS: This is derived from the Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 rule) in statistics:

    68% of data falls within ±1 standard deviation.
    95% of data falls within ±1.96 standard deviations.
    99.7% of data falls within ±3 standard deviations.


#### Step-by-step calculation:
1. Calculate $\hat{p}$($1 -\hat{p}$):
   
   $\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p}) = 0.6529 \cdot (1 - 0.6529) = 0.6529 \cdot 0.3471 = 0.2267$
   

2. Divide by n :
   $\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n} = \frac{0.2267}{121} = 0.001874$
   

3. Take the square root:
   $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{0.001874} = 0.0433 $

4. Multiply by  Z = 1.96  (for 95% confidence):
   ME = $1.96 \cdot 0.0433 = 0.0848 \text{ (approximately } 0.085 \text{)}$

---

### Final Answers:
1. **Point Estimate $\hat{p}$**:  0.653 
2. **Margin of Error ME **:  0.0848

This means the probability  p  is approximately  0.653 , with a margin of error of  $0.0848 \$.\
\
PS:
The margin of error (±0.085) means that we are reasonably confident (usually at a 95% confidence level if Z=1.96Z=1.96) that the true proportion of convicts (pp) who will lead crime-free lives for at least 3 years after prison release lies within the range:\
$p^±ME$=0.653±0.085\


This gives us the confidence interval:
[0.653−0.085,0.653+0.085]=[0.568,0.738]
[0.653−0.085,0.653+0.085]=[0.568,0.738]
