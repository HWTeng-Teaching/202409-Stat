***Population III A population consists of N 54 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of m 517. A random sample of n52 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. Use this information to answer the questions in Exercises 7â€“9.***

***7. How many possible random samples are there when sampling without replacement? List the possible samples. Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean x and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.***
