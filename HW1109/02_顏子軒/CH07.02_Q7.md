**Population III A population consists of $N=54$ numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of $\mu$ = 17. A random sample of $n=52$ is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement. Use this information to answer the questions in Exercises 7â€“9.**

**7. How many possible random samples are there when sampling without replacement? List the possible samples. Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean $\overline{x}$ and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.**
