Antibiotics: You want to estimate the mean hourly yield for a process that manufactures an antibiotic. You observe the process for 100 hourly periods chosen at random, with the results $\bar{x} = 1020$ grams per hour and s = 90. Estimate the mean hourly yield for the process and calculate the margin of error.

Given:

Sample size (n) = 100

Sample mean ($\bar{x}$) = 1020 grams per hour

Sample Standard deviation (s) = 90 garms per hour
