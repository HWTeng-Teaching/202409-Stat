Eco-Friendly: A USA today snapshot found that 47% of Americans associate "recycling" with Earth Day.
Suppose a random sample of n = 100 adults are polled and the 47% figure is correct.

Use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to answer the questions.
Population proportion, p = 0.47.
Sample size, n = 100
Sample proportion, $\hat{p}$, is the proportion of people in the sample who associate "recycling" with Earth Day.

a. Does the distribution of $\hat{p}$, the sample proportion of Americans who associate "recycling" with Earth Day, have an approximate normal distribution? If so, what is its mean and standard deviation?

The distribution of the sample propotion $\hat{p}$ will be approximately normal if the following conditions are met:

$n \cdot p ≥ 10 $ 
$100 \cdot 0.47 = 47 ≥ 10 $

$p \cdot (1-p) ≥ 10 $




b. What is the probability that the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is less than 0.45?

c. What is the probability that $\hat{p}$ lies in the interval .42 to .45?

d. What might you conclude about p if the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30?
