A certain type of automobile battery is known to last an average of 1110 days with a standard deviation of 80 days.
If 400 of these batteries are selected, find the following probabilities for the average length of life of the selected batteries:

1. Consider a sample of size n following a distribution
$\mathcal{G} := \mathcal{G} (mean = \mu, variance = \sigma^{2})$
2. Suppose $X_{1},...,X_{n}$ ~ $^{iid} \mathcal{G}$ are identically and independently distributed (iid) with mean = $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ standrad deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ also called as the standard error(SE)
3. Define sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma{X_{i}}}{n}$. Then, $E(\bar{X_{n}}) = \mu$, var($\bar{X_{n}}$) = $\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$


Central Limit Theorem (Sample Mean) says: when n is large ($n \geq 30$):

$\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \to N(0,1) \text{ as } n \to \infty$

The normalized sample mean converges to the standard normal random variable in distribution.

Population: $X \sim N(1110, 80^{2})$

Define $\bar{X}_{400}$ as the average length of life for 400 selected batteries

Standard error (SE) $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ = $\frac{80}{\sqrt{400}}$ = 4


a. Probability of the average is between 1100 and 1110.

Find $P(1100 < \bar{X}_{400} < 1110)$

$P(\frac{1100-1110}{4} < \frac{\bar{X}_{400}-1110}{4} < \frac{1110-1110}{4})$
= P(-2.5 < Z < 0) = P(Z < 0) - P(Z < -2.5)


b. The average is greater than 1120.

Find $P(\bar{X}_{400} > 1120)$

$P(\frac{\bar{X}_{400}-1110}{4} > \frac{1120-1110}{4})$
= P(Z > 2.5) = 1 - P(Z < 2.5)



c. The average is less than 900.

Find $P(\bar{X}_{400} < 900)$
