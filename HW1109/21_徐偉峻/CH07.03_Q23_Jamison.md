A certain type of automobile battery is known to last an average of 1110 days with a standard deviation of 80 days.
If 400 of these batteries are selected, find the following probabilities for the average length of life of the selected batteries:

1. Consider a sample of size n following a distribution
$\mathcal{G} := \mathcal{G} (mean = \mu, variance = \sigma^{2})$
2. Suppose $X_{1},...,X_{n}$ ~ $^{iid} \mathcal{G}$ are identically and independently distributed (iid) with mean = $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$
3. Define sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma{X_{i}}}{n}$
Central Limit Theorem (Sample Mean) says: when n is large ($n \geq 30$):

$\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \to N(0,1) \text{ as } n \to \infty$

The normalized sample mean converges to the standard normal random variable in distribution.



a. The average is between 1100 and 1110.

b. The average is greater than 1120.

c. The average is less than 900.
