A certain type of automobile battery is known to last an average of 1110 days with a standard deviation of 80 days.
If 400 of these batteries are selected, find the following probabilities for the average length of life of the selected batteries:


Central Limit Theorem (Sample Mean) says: when n is large ($ n \geq 30$):

$frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \to ï¼®(0,1) as n \to \infty$ 





a. The average is between 1100 and 1110.

b. The average is greater than 1120.

c. The average is less than 900.
