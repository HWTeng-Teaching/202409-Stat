# CH07.02_Q7 #
A population consist of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of $\mu = 17$. 
A random sample of n = 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement.
How many possible random samples are there when sampling without replacement? List the possible samples.
Find the sampling distrubtion for the sample mean $\bar x$ and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.

a. the possible random samples without replacement is 4*3 = 12
