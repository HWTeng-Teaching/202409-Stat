Tossing Coins: A fair coin is tossed n = 80 times. Let $\hat{p}$ be the sample propotion of heads. Find P(.44 < $\hat{p}$ < .61).



The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ follows a normal distribution when n is large $(n \cdot p \geq 10 \, n \cdot (1 - p) \geq 10)$

$\hat{p} \sim N\left(p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n}\right) $ where p = 0.5, and variance = $\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$ = $\frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{80} = 0.003125$
