O Canada! The National Hocley Leugue has approximately 70% of its players born outside the United States. In a random sample of n = 50 NHL players, what is the probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the United States exceeds 80%?

Given: 

1. Proportion of plyers born outside the U.S., p = 0.70.
2. Sample size, n = 50.
3. We need to find P($\hat{p} > 0.80$), where ($\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion of players born outside the U.S.

From the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ follows an approximately normal distribution with:

Mean $\mu_{\hat{p}} = p = 0.70$.
