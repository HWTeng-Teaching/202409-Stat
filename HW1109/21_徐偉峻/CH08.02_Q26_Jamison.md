Recidivism: An experimental rehabilitation technique was used on released convicts. It was shown that 79 of 121 men subjected to the technique pursued useful and crime-free lives for a 3-year period following prison release. Find a point estimate for p, the probabilitu that a convict subjected to the rehabilition technique will follow a crime-free existence for at least 3 years after prison release. Calculate the margin of error.



x = 79
Tontal number of individuals: n = 121

Point Estimate for (p):

$\hat{p} = \frac{79}{121} = 0.653$
