A population consist of N = 4 numbers: 10, 15, 21, 22 with a mean of $\mu = 17$. 
A random sample of n = 2 is selected in one of two ways: first, without replacement and second, with replacement.
How many possible random samples are available when sampling with replacement? Find the sampling distribution for the sample mean $ \bar x $ and display it as a table and as a probability histogram.
