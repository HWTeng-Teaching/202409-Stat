The amount of potassium (K) in food varies, but bananas are often associated with high potassium, with approximately 422 mg in a medium-sized banana. Suppose the distribution of potassium in a banana is normally distributed, with mean equal to 422 mg and standard deviation equal to 13 mg per banana.

You eat n = 3 bananas per day, and T is the total number of milligrams of potassium you receive from them.

a. Find the mean and standard devation of T.

The total potassium (K) content T from three bananas is the sum of independent normal random variables. If each banana's potassium content follows $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, the mean and variance of T can be conputed as follows:

1. Mean of T:
$\mu_{T} = n \cdot \mu\ = 3 \cdot 422 = 1266mg$

2. Variance of T: Variance of the sum of independent variables is the sum of their variances:
$\sigma_{T}^{2} = n \cdot \sigma^{2} = 3 \cdot 13^{2} = 507$
Standard deviation of T:
$\sigma_{T} = \sqrt{\sigma_{T}^{2}} = \sqrt{507} = 22.5166$



b. Find the probability that your total daily intake of potassium from the three bananas will exceed 1300 mg.

Probability that P(T > 1300)

Convert to the standard normal variable Z: Z = $\fraction{T-\mu_{T}}{\sigma_{T}}
