70% of NHL's players born outside the U.S.  
Sample size = n =50  

### What is the probability that the sample proportion of players born outside the U.S. exceeds 80%?

p = the portion of players born outside the U.S. = 0.7  

Mean of $\hat{p} = p = 0.7$  
Standard deviation of $\hat{p}$ = $\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{50}} = \sqrt{0.0042} \approx 0.0648$  

Sample meam = $\hat{p}$  

$\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}} \rightarrow Z$    

$P(\hat{p} \gt 0.8) = 1 - P( z \lt \frac{0.8-0.7}{0.0648} \approx 1 - P( z \lt 1.54) = 1 - 0.9382 = 0.0618$
