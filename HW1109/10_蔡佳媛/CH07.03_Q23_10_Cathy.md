Population mean = $\mu$ = 1110 days  
Standard Deviation = $\sigma$ = 80 days  
Number of samples = n = 400  

### Find the probabilities for the average length of life of the selected batteries:

#### a. The average is between 1100 and 1110.  

$\frac{1100-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = $

#### b. The average is greater than 1120.  



#### c. The average is less than 900.
