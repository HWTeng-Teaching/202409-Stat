Population mean = $\mu$ = 1110 days  
Standard Deviation = $\sigma$ = 80 days  
Number of samples = n = 400  

### Find the probabilities for the average length of life of the selected batteries:

#### a. The average is between 1100 and 1110.  

$\frac{1100-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{1100-1110}{\frac{80}{\sqrt{400}}} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5$

$\frac{1110-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{1110-1110}{\frac{80}{\sqrt{400}}} = \frac{0}{4} = 0$

$p(-2.5 \leq z \leq 0)$


#### b. The average is greater than 1120.  



#### c. The average is less than 900.
