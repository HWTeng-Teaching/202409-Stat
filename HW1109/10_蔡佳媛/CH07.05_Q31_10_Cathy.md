Sample size = n =100  
Sample mean = 0.47  

### a. Dose the distribution of $\hat{p}$ have an approximate normal distribution? If so, what is the mean and standard deviation? 






### b. What is the probability that the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is less than 0.45?



### c. What is the probability that $\hat{p}$ lies in the interval 0.42 to 0.45?



### d. What might you conclude about $p$ if the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30?
