47% of Americans associate "recycling" with Earth Day  
Sample size = n =100  

### a. Dose the distribution of $\hat{p}$ have an approximate normal distribution? If so, what is the mean and standard deviation? 

The Central Limit Theorem says: when $n$ is large $( n \geq 30)$:

$\frac{\bar{X_n} - \mu}{\sigma/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{pq/n}} \stackrel{d.}\longrightarrow N(0,1)$ as n $\longrightarrow \infty$ 

Therefore, the distribution of $\hat{p}$ have an approximate normal distribution.  

$Bernoulli(p=0.47), \mu = 0.47, \sigma^2 = pq = 0.47 \times 0.53 = 0.2491$

$mean =\mu = p = 0.47$  
$var(\bar{X_{100}} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \frac{pq}{n} = \frac{0.2491}{100} = 0.002491$  
standard deviation = $\sqrt{0.02491} \approx 0.0499$


### b. What is the probability that the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is less than 0.45?



### c. What is the probability that $\hat{p}$ lies in the interval 0.42 to 0.45?



### d. What might you conclude about $p$ if the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30?
