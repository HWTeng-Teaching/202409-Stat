Population mean = $\mu$ = 422mg  
Population standard deviation = $\sigma$ = 13mg
Sample size = n = 3  

You eat 3 bananas per day, and T is the total number of milligrams of postassium you receive from them.

$T = x_1 + x_2 + x_3$

#### a. Find the mean and standard deviation of T.



#### b. Find the probability that your total daily intake of postassium from the three bananas will exceed 1300mg.
