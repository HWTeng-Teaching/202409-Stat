47% of Americans associate "recycling" with Earth Day  
Sample size = n =100  

a. $\hat{p}$ 的分佈將“回收”與地球日關聯的美國人，是否具有近似的常態分佈？ 如果是，請問它的平均值和標準差？

### a. Dose the distribution of $\hat{p}$ have an approximate normal distribution? If so, what is the mean and standard deviation? 

The Central Limit Theorem says: when $n$ is large $( n \geq 30)$:

$\frac{\bar{X_n} - \mu}{\sigma/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{pq/n}} \stackrel{d.}\longrightarrow N(0,1)$ as n $\longrightarrow \infty$ 

Therefore, the distribution of $\hat{p}$ have an approximate normal distribution.  

$X \sim Bernoulli(n=100, p=0.47), \mu = 0.47, \sigma^2 = pq = 0.47 \times 0.53 = 0.2491$

$mean =\mu = p = 0.47$  
$var(\bar{X_{100}} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \frac{pq}{n} = \frac{0.2491}{100} = 0.002491$  
standard deviation = $\sqrt{0.02491} \approx 0.0499$

b. $\hat{p}$ 小於 0.45 的機率是多少？
### b. What is the probability that the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is less than 0.45?

$P(\hat{p} \lt 0.45) \stackrel{z}\sim P( z \lt \frac{0.45-0.47}{0.0499}) \approx P( z \lt -0.40) = 0.3446$

### c. What is the probability that $\hat{p}$ lies in the interval 0.42 to 0.45?

$P(0.42 \lt \hat{p} \lt 0.45) \stackrel{z}\sim  P( \frac{0.42-0.47}{0.0499} \lt z \lt \frac{0.45-0.47}{0.0499}) \approx P( -1.00 \lt z \lt -0.40) = P( z \lt -0.40) - P( z \lt -1.00) = 0.3446 - 0.1587 = 0.1859$

### d. What might you conclude about $p$ if the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30?

$P(\hat{p} \lt 0.30) \stackrel{z}\sim P( z \lt \frac{0.30-0.47}{0.0499}) = P( z \lt -3.40) \approx 0$

The probability of observing a z-score less than -3.40 is extremely small. 
If the observed sample proportion were less than 0.30, it would be reasonable to conclude that the true population proportion ($p$) is likely different from 0.47.  
This significant deviation indicates that either the initial assumption about the population proportion was incorrect, or there might be some other factors affecting the sample.
