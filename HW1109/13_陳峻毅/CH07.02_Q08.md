# Problem 8: Sampling With Replacement

### Given:
- **Population**:  N = 4 , elements = (10, 15, 21, 22)
- **Sample Size**:  n = 2 

### 1. Total Number of Possible Samples:
$N^n = 4^2 = 16$

All possible ordered pairs (with replacement):

${(10, 10), (10, 15), (10, 21), (10, 22), (15, 10), (15, 15), \dots, (22, 22)\}$

---

### 2. Sample Means:
For each sample, calculate the mean $\bar{x\}$:

$\bar{x\}$ = $\frac{\text{sum of the elements in the sample}}{2}$

For example:

$(10, 10) \rightarrow \bar{x\}$ = $\frac{10 + 10}{2} = 10.0$\
$(10, 15) \rightarrow \bar{x\}$ = $\frac{10 + 15}{2} = 12.5$\
$(10, 21) \rightarrow \bar{x\}$ = $\frac{10 + 21}{2} = 15.5$
.......
Repeat for all 16 samples.

### 3. Sampling Distribution of Sample Means:
The frequency and probability for each unique sample mean are summarized in the table below:

### 4. Probability Histogram:
The probability histogram can be represented as follows:

X-axis: Sample Means ($\bar{x}$) $\quad | \quad Y-axis$: Probabilities
Each bar corresponds to a unique sample mean, with the height proportional to its probability.

### Conclusion:
- The sampling distribution of sample means for  n = 2 with replacement is shown in the table above.
- The histogram visually demonstrates the probabilities for each sample mean.
