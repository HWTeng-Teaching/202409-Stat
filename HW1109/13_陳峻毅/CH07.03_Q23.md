# Solution

We are tasked with finding the probabilities for the average length of life of 400 selected batteries, given the following:

- Population mean: $\mu $= 1110 days
- Population standard deviation: $\sigma$ = 80 days
- Sample size: n = 400 

The sample mean distribution has the following properties:
1. Mean of the sampling distribution: $\mu_{\bar{x}}$ = $\mu = 1110 $
2. Standard error of the mean (SEM): 
   
$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{80}{\sqrt{400}} = \frac{80}{20} = 4
\$

## Part (a): The average is between 1100 and 1110

We need to find:
$P(1100 \leq \bar{x} \leq 1110)$

Convert the sample means to $z$-scores:
$z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{\bar{x}}}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}$\
For $1100$:\
$z = \frac{1100 - 1110}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5$\
For $1110$:\
$z = \frac{1110 - 1110}{4} = 0$

Using the standard normal distribution table, find the cumulative probabilities:
$P(z = -2.5) \approx 0.0062,\quad P(z = 0) = 0.5000$
Thus:
$P(1100 \leq \bar{x} \leq 1110) = P(z = 0) - P(z = -2.5) = 0.5000 - 0.0062 = 0.4938$

---

## Part (b): The average is greater than 1120

We need to find:
$P(\bar{x} > 1120)$

Convert $1120$ to a $z$-score:
$z = \frac{1120 - 1110}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5$

Using the standard normal distribution table:
$P(z = 2.5) \approx 0.9938$
Thus:
$P(\bar{x} > 1120) = 1 - P(z = 2.5) = 1 - 0.9938 = 0.0062$

---

## Part (c): The average is less than 900

We need to find:
$P(\bar{x} < 900)$
Convert $900$ to a $z$-score:
$z = \frac{900 - 1110}{4} = \frac{-210}{4} = -52.5$

The $z$-score of $-52.5$ is extremely small, so:
$P(\bar{x} < 900) \approx 0$

---

## Final Results

- (a) $P(1100 \leq \bar{x} \leq 1110) = 0.4938$
- (b) $P(\bar{x} > 1120) = 0.0062$
- (c) $P(\bar{x} < 900) \approx 0$
