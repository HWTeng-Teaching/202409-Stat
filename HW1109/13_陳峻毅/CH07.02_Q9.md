# Solution

## Problem Conditions
The population consists of $N = 4$ numbers: $\{10, 15, 21, 22\}$, with a population mean $\mu = 17$. A random sample of $n = 2$ is selected in two scenarios: **without replacement** and **with replacement**.

---

## 1. Without Replacement Sampling

### All Possible Sample Combinations ($n = 2$):
$(10, 15),\ (10, 21),\ (10, 22),\ (15, 21),\ (15, 22),\ (21, 22)$

### Calculate Each Sample Mean:

$$\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}\hline\text{Sample Combinations} & \bar{x} & P(\bar{x}) \\ 
\hline
(10, 15) & 12.5 & \frac{1}{6} \\ 
(10, 21) & 15.5 & \frac{1}{6} \\ 
(10, 22) & 16.0 & \frac{1}{6} \\ 
(15, 21) & 18.0 & \frac{1}{6} \\ 
(15, 22) & 18.5 & \frac{1}{6} \\ 
(21, 22) & 21.5 & \frac{1}{6} \\ 
\hline\end{array}$$

### Mean of the Sample Means:
$\mu_{\bar{x}}$ = $\frac{\sum \bar{x}}{\text{Number of Samples}} $= $\frac{12.5 + 15.5 + 16 + 18 + 18.5 + 21.5}{6} = 17$

---

## 2. With Replacement Sampling

### All Possible Sample Combinations:
The population is $\{10, 15, 21, 22\}$, and with replacement, all possible sample pairs ($n = 2$) result in $4 \times 4 = 16$ combinations:
$(10, 10),\ (10, 15),\ (10, 21),\ (10, 22),\ \dots,\ (22, 22)$

Since the sampling is independent and the population mean $\mu = 17$, the mean of the sample means is also:
$$\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu = 17$$

---

## Conclusion

In both scenarios:
$\mu_{\bar{x}} = 17$
The mean of the sample means ($\mu_{\bar{x}}$) is equal to the population mean ($\mu = 17$).
