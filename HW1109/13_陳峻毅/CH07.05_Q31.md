# Eco-Friendly: A USA Today Snapshot

A **USA Today** snapshot found that 47% of Americans associate "recycling" with Earth Day. Suppose a random sample of n = 100 adults are polled, and the 47% figure is correct. Answer the following questions:

---

## Given Information
- Population proportion: p = 0.47 
- Sample size: n = 100 
- Sampling distribution: $\hat{p}\$, the sample proportion.

---

## **Part (a): Approximation to a Normal Distribution**

The sampling distribution of $\hat{p}\$ can be approximated as normal if the following conditions are satisfied:
1. $n \cdot p \geq 10 $,
2. $n \cdot (1 - p) \geq 10\$.

**Check conditions**:

$n \cdot p = 100 \cdot 0.47 = 47 \geq 10, \quad n \cdot (1-p) = 100 \cdot 0.53 = 53 \geq 10$

Since both conditions are satisfied, the distribution of \(\hat{p}\) is approximately normal.

- **Mean**:
  
  $\mu_{\hat{p}} = p = 0.47\$
  
- **Standard Deviation**:
  
  $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.47(1-0.47)}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.47 \cdot 0.53}{100}} = \sqrt{0.002491} \approx 0.0499\$

## **Part (b): Probability that ($\hat{p} < 0.45\$)**

To find$ P($\hat{p} < 0.45\$), standardize using the Z-score formula:

$Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \mu_{\hat{p}}}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}$


For$\hat{p} = 0.45\$:

$Z = \frac{0.45 - 0.47}{0.0499} = \frac{-0.02}{0.0499} \approx -0.4008\$


Using the standard normal table:

$P(Z < -0.4008) \approx 0.3446$

Thus:

$P(\hat{p} < 0.45) \approx 0.3446$
--
## **Part (c): Probability that $\hat{p}\$ lies in the interval $[0.42, 0.45]$**

We calculate  P($0.42 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.45$)as:

P($0.42 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.45\$) = P($\hat{p} \leq 0.45) - P(\hat{p} \leq 0.42\$)


1. **Find $P(\hat{p} \leq 0.45) \)$:**
   From part (b):
   
   P($\hat{p} \leq 0.45) \approx 0.3446\$)
   

2. **Find $P(\hat{p} \leq 0.42) \)$:**
   Standardize \(\hat{p} = 0.42\):
     Z = $\frac{0.42 - 0.47}{0.0499} = \frac{-0.05}{0.0499} \approx -1.002\$

   Using the standard normal table:
   P($Z < -1.002) \approx 0.1589$

3. **Calculate the probability**:
   
   P($0.42 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.45$) = P($\hat{p} \leq 0.45) - P(\hat{p} \leq 0.42\$)   
   P$(0.42 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.45$) = 0.3446 - 0.1589 = 0.1857$\

Thus:

P($0.42 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.45) \approx 0.1857$

---

## **Part (d): Conclusion if observed $\hat{p} < 0.30\)$**

If the observed sample proportion is $\hat{p} < 0.30\$, we calculate the likelihood of this event under the assumption  p = 0.47 . Standardize $\hat{p} = 0.30\$:

$Z = \frac{0.30 - 0.47}{0.0499} = \frac{-0.17}{0.0499} \approx -3.406\$

Using the standard normal table:
$P(Z < -3.406) \approx 0.0003$

This probability 0.03%  is extremely small, suggesting that an observed proportion less than 0.30  would be highly unlikely if  p = 0.47. Therefore, we might conclude that the true proportion p is not 0.47.

## **Final Answers**

(a) The distribution of $\hat{p}\$ is approximately normal with:
$\mu_{\hat{p}} = 0.47\$, $\quad \sigma_{\hat{p}} \$approx 0.0499\$

(b) The probability that $\hat{p} < 0.45\$ is:
$P(\hat{p} < 0.45) \approx 0.3446$

(c) The probability that $\hat{p}\)$ lies in the interval $[0.42, 0.45]$ is:
$P(0.42 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.45) \approx 0.1857$

(d) If the observed $\hat{p} < 0.30\$, it is highly unlikely $P \approx 0.0003\$, suggesting that $ p = 0.47 $ might not be correct.
