### a. What hypotheses would you test to make sure the average amount of ground beef was indeed 1 pound?

$H_{0}$: $\mu$ = 1  
$H_{a}$: $\mu \neq$ 1  

### b. Find the p-value for the test and use it to perform the test in part a.

#### Set up $\alpha$ = 0.05

#### Test Statisitc:
$Z_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}} \stackrel{d.}\rightarrow$ Z = $\frac{1.01-1}{0.18/\sqrt{35}} = 0.328671 \approx$ 0.33

#### Find (a) the rejection region and (b) the p-value

  (a) the rejection region  
      { $z: z < -z_{\alpha/2}$ , $z > z_{\alpha/2}$ } = { z: z < $-z_{0.025}$, z > $z_{0.025}$ } = {z: z < -1.96, z > 1.96 }

  (b) the p-value  
      P(z > 0.33) + P( z < -0.33) = 2 $\times$ P(z < -0.33) = 2 $\times$ 0.3707 = 0.7414

#### Conclude

  (a) $Z_{STAT}$ = 0.33 does not fall into the rejection region and $H_{0}$ is not rejected  
  (b) p-value = 0.7414 > $\alpha$ = 0.05, $H_{0}$ is not rejected

### As the quality control, how would you report the results to a consumer interest group?

The average amount of ground beef is likely to be 1 pound.  
There is not enough evidence to indicate that the average amount of ground beef is not 1 pound.
