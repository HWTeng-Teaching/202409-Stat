### a. What hypotheses would you test to make sure the average amount of ground beef was indeed 1 pound?

$H_{0}$: $\mu$ = 1  
$H_{a}$: $\mu \neq$ 1  

### b. Find the p-value for the test and use it to perform the test in part a.

#### Set up $\alpha$ = 0.05

#### Test Statisitc:
$Z_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}} \stackrel{d.}\rightarrow$ Z = $\frac{1.01-1}{0.18/\sqrt{35}} \approx$ 0.328671
