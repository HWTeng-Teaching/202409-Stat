$p$ = survival rate = 1 - $\frac{1}{3}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$  
$n$ = 200  
$x$ = the number of those in the sample who survive the disease  


### a. If you wish to determine whether the screening program has been effective, state the alternative hypothesis that should be tested.

$H_{a}$: $p \gt \frac{2}{3}$


### b. State the null hypothesis.

$H_{0}$: $p \leq \frac{2}{3}$


### c. If 164 women in the sample of 200 survive the disease, can you conclude that the screening program was effective? Test using $\alpha$ = 0.05 and explain the pratical conclusions from your test.

$z_{STAT} \approx \frac{\frac{164}{200}-\frac{2}{3}}{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}}{200}}} \approx$ 4.6    

z $gt$ 1.645 falls into rejection region and $H_{0}$ is rejected

### d. Find the p-value for the test and interpret it.  

P( z $\gt$ 4.6) $\approx$ 0 $\lt \alpha$, $H_{0}$ is rejected
