56% of the participants indicated that they would not ride in a driverless car  
87% favor a requirement of having a human in the driver's seat  
n = 500  
$\alpha$ = 0.05


### a. Whether more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car.

$H_{0}$: $p \gt$ 0.5  
$H_{a}$: $p \leq$ 0.5  

Test statistic: z $\approx \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0}q_{0}}{n}}}$ = $\frac{0.5-0.56}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times 0.5}{500}}}$ = -2.683282 $\approx$ -2.68

z = -2.68 is less than -1.645, reject $H_{0}$

### b. Use the p-value approach. Do the two approaches lead to the same conclusion?  

P(z $\lt$ -2.68) = 0.0037, which is less than $\alpha$, $H_{0}$ is ejected
