$\mu$ = 5.86  
n = 40  
$\bar{x}$ = 5.56  
s = 0.7  

### a. Does the data indicate that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at their facility is less than 5.86 kilograms? Test using $\alpha$ = 0.05.  

$H_{0}$: $\mu \geq$ 5.86  
$H_{a}$: $\mu \lt$ 5.86  

$Z_{STAT} = \frac{5.56-5.86}{0.7/\sqrt{40}}$ = -2.710524 $\approx$ -2.71  

rejection region = { z: z > $z_{\alpha}$ } = { z: z > $z_{0.05}$ } = {z: z > 1.645 }  

$Z_{STAT}$ = -2.71 does not fall into the rejection region and $H_{0}$ is not rejected  

### b. What is the p-value associated with the test in part a.? Can you reject $H_{0}$ at the 5% level of significance using the p-value?

p-value: P(z > -2.71) = 1 - P(z < -2.71) = 1 - 0.0034 = 0.9966 > $\alpha$, $H_{0}$ is not rejected
