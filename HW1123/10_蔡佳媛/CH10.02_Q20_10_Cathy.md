### Test hypothesis that the average CBF for stroke patients different from that of healthy prople using $\alpha$ = 0.05

$H_{0}$: $\mu$ = 74
$H_{a}$: $\mu \neq$ 74

set $\alpha$ = 0.05

t = $\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}}$ = -1.34375 $\approx$ -1.34

df = n-1 = 24  
$t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}$ = $t_{0.025, 24}$ = 2.064

Reject $H_{0}$ if t $\gt$ 2.064 or t $\lt$ -2.064.  
The test statistic is greater than -2.064, does not fall into the rejection region, $H_{0}$ is not rejected.
