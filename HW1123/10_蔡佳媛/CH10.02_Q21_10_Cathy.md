### Find a 90% confidence interval for the mean growth of a population of 4-year-old red pine trees  

$\alpha$ = 0.1  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b307e77-dddd-44a5-adb8-b59e2068993f)  

confidence interval for $\mu$ as $\bar{x} \pm t_{ ( n - 1 );\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$  

90% confidence interval for $\mu$ = 28.7 $\pm t_{ 16; 0.05 }$ \times \frac{8.6}{\sqrt{17}} = [25.058182, 32.341818]
