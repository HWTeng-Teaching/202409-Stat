20% of all samll businesses fail in their first year  
n = 200, 30 of small businesses were recorded as failed

### a. If we wish to test the claim that the new tax laws help small businesses survive, how would we express $H_{0}$ and $H_{a}$?

$H_{0}$: $p \lt$ 0.2  
$H_{a}$: $p \geq$ 0.2  

### b. Find the value of the test statistic based on $\hat{p}$, the sample proportion of failed small businesses.

Test statistic: z $\approx \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0}q_{0}}{n}}}$ = $\frac{\frac{30}{200}-0.2}{\sqrt{\frac{0.2 \times 0.8}{200}}}$ = -1.767767 $\approx$ -1.77


### c. What is the rejection region based on a significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.05? Can you conclude that the new tax structure helps samll businesses survive?

rejection region = { z: z < -1.645 }  

Since the observed value of the test statistic falls in the rejection region (z = -1.77 is less than -1.645), reject $H_{0}$.

### d. Find the p-value for the test. Does your conclusion in part c change?

P(z < -1.77) = 0.0384, which is less than 0.05, $H_{0}$ is rejected
