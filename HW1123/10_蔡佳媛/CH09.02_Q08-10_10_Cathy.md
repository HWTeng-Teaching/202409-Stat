### 8. A left-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.01$

$z_{-0.01} = -2.33$

Compare the observed value of the test statistic, z = -2.41, with the critical value necessary for rejection, $z_{-0.01} = -2.33$.  
Since the observed value of the test statistic falls in the rejection region, you can reject $H_{0}$.  
The probability that you have made an incorrect decision is $\alpha = 0.01$  

### 9. A left-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.05$


### 10. A two-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.02$
