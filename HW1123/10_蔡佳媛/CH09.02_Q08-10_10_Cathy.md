### 8. A left-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.01$

$z_{-0.01} = -2.33$

Compare the observed value of the test statistic, z = -2.41, with the critical value necessary for rejection, $z_{-0.01} = -2.33$.  
Since the observed value of the test statistic falls in the rejection region (z = -2.41 is less than -2.33), reject $H_{0}$.  
The probability of making an incorrect decision is $\alpha = 0.01$  

### 9. A left-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.05$

$z_{-0.05} = -1.645$

Compare the observed value of the test statistic, z = -2.41, with the critical value necessary for rejection, $z_{-0.05} = -1.645$.  
Since the observed value of the test statistic falls in the rejection region (z = -2.41 is less than -1.645), reject $H_{0}$.  
The probability of making an incorrect decision is $\alpha = 0.05$  

### 10. A two-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.02$

$z_{\frac{0.02}{2}} = 2.33$, so the critical vavlues are -2.33 and 2.33  

Compare the observed value of the test statistic, z = -2.41, with the critical value necessary for rejection, $z_{-0.01} = -2.33$.  
Since the observed value of the test statistic falls in the rejection region (z = -2.41 is less than -2.33), reject $H_{0}$.  
The probability of making an incorrect decision is $\alpha = 0.02$
