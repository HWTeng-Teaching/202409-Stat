**a. State the null hypothesis Ho**

$$
H_0: \mu = 80\%
$$

**b. State the null hypothesis Ha**

$$
H_a: \mu \neq 80\%
$$

**c. Conduct a statistical test**

$$
\bar{X}_n = 79.7%, \quad \mu_0 = 5.86, \quad s = 0.70, \quad n = 100
$$

$$
- Sample size (\(n\)) = 100  
- Sample mean (\(\bar{x}\)) = 79.7%  
- Population mean (\(\mu_0\)) = 80%  
- Sample standard deviation (\(s\)) = 0.8%  
- Significance level (\(\alpha\)) = 0.05  
$$


#### Step 1: Calculate the test statistic (z-score)

The formula for the z-test is:

\[
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
z = \frac{79.7 - 80}{\frac{0.8}{\sqrt{100}}}
\]

\[
z = \frac{-0.3}{0.08} = -3.75
\]

#### Step 2: Determine the critical value

For a two-tailed test with \(\alpha = 0.05\):

- The critical z-value is \(\pm 1.96\) (from z-tables).

---

#### Step 3: Compare the test statistic with the critical value

- The calculated z-value (\(-3.75\)) is less than the critical value (\(-1.96\)).  

---

### Final Answer

Since the z-value falls in the rejection region, we **reject the null hypothesis** (\(H_0\)).

There is sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to refute the manufacturer's claim that the mean potency of the antibiotic is 80%.
