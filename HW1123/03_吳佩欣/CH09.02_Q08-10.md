$$
z_{\text{STAT}} = -2.41
$$

### **8: A left-tailed test with \(\alpha = 0.01\)**
- **Critical value**: For a left-tailed test at \(\alpha = 0.01\), the critical value is the z-score corresponding to the cumulative probability of 0.01.

  Using a z-table or standard normal distribution calculator:

$$
z_{\text{critical}} = -2.33
$$

- **Rejection region**: Reject \(H_0\) if \(z < -2.33\).

- **Comparison**: The observed \(z = -2.41\), which is less than \(-2.33\).

- **Conclusion**: Reject \(H_0\). The result is statistically significant at the 0.01 level.

### **Question 9: A left-tailed test with \(\alpha = 0.05\)**

- **Critical value**: For a left-tailed test at \(\alpha = 0.05\), the critical value is the z-score corresponding to the cumulative probability of 0.05.

  Using a z-table:
  \[
  z_{\text{critical}} = -1.645
  \]

- **Rejection region**: Reject \(H_0\) if \(z < -1.645\).

- **Comparison**: The observed \(z = -2.41\), which is less than \(-1.645\).

- **Conclusion**: Reject \(H_0\). The result is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

---

### **Question 10: A two-tailed test with \(\alpha = 0.02\)**

- **Critical values**: For a two-tailed test at \(\alpha = 0.02\), split the significance level equally into the two tails (\(\alpha/2 = 0.01\)). The critical z-scores are:
  \[
  z_{\text{critical}} = \pm 2.33
  \]

- **Rejection region**: Reject \(H_0\) if \(z < -2.33\) or \(z > 2.33\).

- **Comparison**: The observed \(z = -2.41\), which is less than \(-2.33\).

- **Conclusion**: Reject \(H_0\). The result is statistically significant at the 0.02 level.

### **Summary of Results**

| Question | Rejection Region                  | Observed \(z\) | Decision       | Reliability                |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| 8        | \(z < -2.33\)                    | \(-2.41\)      | Reject \(H_0\) | Significant at \(\alpha = 0.01\) |
| 9        | \(z < -1.645\)                   | \(-2.41\)      | Reject \(H_0\) | Significant at \(\alpha = 0.05\) |
| 10       | \(z < -2.33\) or \(z > 2.33\)    | \(-2.41\)      | Reject \(H_0\) | Significant at \(\alpha = 0.02\) |
