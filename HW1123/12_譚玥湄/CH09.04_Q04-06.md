p-Values versus Rejection Regions Calculate the p-value
for the hypothesis tests given in Exercises 4–6. The same
tests were performed in Exercises 1–3. Do the conclusions
based on a fixed rejection region agree with those
found using the p-value approach? Should they?
4. n51000 and x5279. You wish to show that p , .3.
5. n51400 and x5529 successes. You wish to show
that p differs from .4.
6. Seventy-two successes in a random sample of
n5120. You wish to show that p . .5.
