p-Values versus Rejection Regions Calculate the p-value for the hypothesis tests given in Exercises 4–6. The same tests were performed in Exercises 1–3.計 Do the conclusions based on a fixed rejection region agree with those
found using the p-value approach? Should they?  
4. n = 1000 and x = 279. You wish to show that p < .3.  
5. n = 1400 and x = 529 successes. You wish to show that p differs from .4.  
6. Seventy-two successes in a random sample of n = 120. You wish to show that p > .5.

4. (1) H0:p=.3. Ha :p<.3 (2) set α =.05 (3) Zstat = (p^- p)/( √(p*(1-p)/n )) , zstat =(0.297-0.3)/√((0.3*0.7)/100 )≈ -1.45 (4) Find the p-value: (z<-1.45) ≈0.0735 (5) Since P-value 0.0735 >α =0.05, don’t reject H0  (6) there is insufficient evidence to support that P < 0.3.
 
5. (2) H0:p=.4. Ha :p<>0.4 (2) set α =.05 (3) Zstat = (p^- p)/( √(p*(1-p)/n )) , zstat =(0.3779-0.4)/√((0.4*0.6)/100 )≈ -1.68 (4) Find the p-value: (z<-1.68) ≈0.093 (5) Since P-value 0.093 >α =0.05, don’t reject H0  (6) there is insufficient evidence to support that p<>0.4.

6. (3) H0:p=.5 Ha :p>0.5 (2) set α =.05 (3) Zstat = (p^- p)/( √(p*(1-p)/n )) ,zstat =(0.6-0.5)/√((0.5*0.5)/120 )≈ 2.191 (4) Find the p-value: (z<-2.191)=1-0.9857=0.0143 (5) Since P-value 0.0143 <α =0.05, reject H0  (6) there is sufficient evidence to support that P > 0.5.
