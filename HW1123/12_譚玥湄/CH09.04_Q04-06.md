p-Values versus Rejection Regions Calculate the p-value for the hypothesis tests given in Exercises 4–6. The same tests were performed in Exercises 1–3. Do the conclusions based on a fixed rejection region agree with those
found using the p-value approach? Should they? 
4. n = 1000 and x = 279. You wish to show that p , .3.
5. n = 1400 and x = 529 successes. You wish to show that p differs from .4.
6. Seventy-two successes in a random sample of n = 120. You wish to show that p . .5.
