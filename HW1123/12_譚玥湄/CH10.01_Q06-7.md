Using the t-distribution table, we can find the critical values ($$alphat$$) corresponding to the given right-tail area ($$alphat$$) and degrees of freedom (df). Here are the values:
________________________________________
2. $$alphat$$=0.05, df=20
•	From the t-table, the critical value is:
t0.05=1.725
________________________________________
3.  $$\alpha$$ = .01, df = 18  
•	From the t-table, the critical value is:
t0.01=2.552
________________________________________
4. $$\alpha$$ = .025, df = 12  
•	From the t-table, the critical value is:
t0.025=2.179
________________________________________
5. $$\alpha$$ = .005, df = 25  
•	From the t-table, the critical value is:
t0.005=2.787
________________________________________
6. $$\alpha$$ = .10, df = 7
•	From the t-table, the critical value is:
t0.10=1.415
