2. $$\alpha$$ = .05, df = 20  
   From the t-table, the critical value is:  $t_{0.05}$=1.725  
   
3.  $$\alpha$$ = .01, df = 18   
  From the t-table, the critical value is:  $t_{0.01}$=2.552

5. $$\alpha$$ = .025, df = 12  
  From the t-table, the critical value is:  $t_{0.025}$=2.179

6. $$\alpha$$ = .005, df = 25  
  From the t-table, the critical value is:  $t_{0.005}$=2.787

7. $$\alpha$$ = .10, df = 7  
  From the t-table, the critical value is:  $t_{t_0.10}$=1.415
