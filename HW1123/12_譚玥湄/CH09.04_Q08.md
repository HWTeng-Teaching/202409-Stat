Ride in a Driverless Car? In a Pew Research report concerning the rise of automation in the United States, 56% of the participants indicated that they would not ride in a driverless car, and 87% favor a requirement of having a human in the driver’s seat in case of an emergency.14 Suppose that the number of participants was n = 500. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that more than a simple majority of Americans would not ride in a driverless car?  
a. Use a formal test of hypothesis with $$\alpha$$ = .05 to determine  whether more than 50% of Americans would  not ride in a driverless car.  
b. Use the p-value approach. Do the two approaches  lead to the same conclusion?  

---
(1) H0 : p=0.5 (exactly half of Americans would not ride in a driverless car). Ha : p>0.5).  
(2) set α =.05 
(3) 計算檢定統計量 Sample proportion P^=0.56 , Zstat = (0.56- 0.5)/√((0.5*0.5)/500 )   =2.6833  
(4) P-value = P(Z>2.6833) ≈ P(Z>2.68) = 1- 0.9963 = 0.0037  
(5) 由 P-value < α= 0.05，故拒絕虛無假設， 
(6)足夠證據顯示 P > 0.5，即超過 50% 的美國人不會乘坐無人駕駛車 

2.Find the 𝑝-Value Using standard normal distribution tables , P(Z>1.899) ≈ 0.0288. 2.Compare 𝑝-Value with 𝛼 , p=0.0288<0.05: Reject H0。

3.Conclusion:The 𝑝-value approach leads to the same conclusion: There is siganificans evidence to suggest that more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car.
