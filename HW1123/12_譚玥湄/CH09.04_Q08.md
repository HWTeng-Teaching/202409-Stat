Ride in a Driverless Car? In a Pew Research report concerning the rise of automation in the United States, 56% of the participants indicated that they would not ride in a driverless car, and 87% favor a requirement of having a human in the driver’s seat in case of an emergency.14 Suppose that the number of participants was n = 500. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that more than a simple majority of Americans would not ride in a driverless car?  
a. Use a formal test of hypothesis with $$\alpha$$ = .05 to determine  whether more than 50% of Americans would  not ride in a driverless car.  
b. Use the p-value approach. Do the two approaches  lead to the same conclusion?

To determine whether more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car, we will perform a hypothesis test. Here's the detailed solution:
________________________________________
a. Hypothesis Test Using α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05
Step 1: State the hypotheses
•	Null hypothesis (H0H_0H0): The proportion of Americans who would not ride in a driverless car is 50% (p=0.50p = 0.50p=0.50).
•	Alternative hypothesis (HaH_aHa): More than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car (p>0.50p > 0.50p>0.50).
This is a one-tailed test.

Step 2: Define the sample statistics
•	Sample size: n=500n = 500n=500,
•	Sample proportion: p^=xn=0.56⋅500500=0.56\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{0.56 \cdot 500}{500} = 0.56p^=nx=5000.56⋅500=0.56,
•	Null hypothesis proportion: p0=0.50p_0 = 0.50p0=0.50.

Step 3: Calculate the test statistic
The test statistic for a proportion is:
z=p^−p0p0(1−p0)nz = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}}}z=np0(1−p0)p^−p0
Substitute the values:
z=0.56−0.500.50⋅(1−0.50)500=0.060.25500=0.060.0005=0.060.02236≈2.68z = \frac{0.56 - 0.50}{\sqrt{\frac{0.50 \cdot (1 - 0.50)}{500}}} = \frac{0.06}{\sqrt{\frac{0.25}{500}}} = \frac{0.06}{\sqrt{0.0005}} = \frac{0.06}{0.02236} \approx 2.68z=5000.50⋅(1−0.50)0.56−0.50=5000.250.06=0.00050.06=0.022360.06≈2.68

Step 4: Determine the rejection region
At α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05, the critical value for a one-tailed test is z=1.645z = 1.645z=1.645.
•	If z>1.645z > 1.645z>1.645, we reject H0H_0H0.
•	Here, z=2.68z = 2.68z=2.68, which exceeds 1.6451.6451.645.
Thus, we reject the null hypothesis.
________________________________________
b. p-Value Approach
Step 1: Calculate the p-value
For z=2.68z = 2.68z=2.68, the p-value is:
P(Z>2.68)P(Z > 2.68)P(Z>2.68)
Using a standard normal table or calculator:
P(Z>2.68)=1−P(Z≤2.68)=1−0.9963=0.0037P(Z > 2.68) = 1 - P(Z \leq 2.68) = 1 - 0.9963 = 0.0037P(Z>2.68)=1−P(Z≤2.68)=1−0.9963=0.0037
Step 2: Compare p-value with α\alphaα
•	The p-value (0.00370.00370.0037) is less than α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05.
Thus, we reject the null hypothesis.
________________________________________
Comparison of the Two Approaches
Both the rejection region approach and the p-value approach lead to the same conclusion: we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion
There is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car.
