Ride in a Driverless Car? In a Pew Research report concerning the rise of automation in the United States, 56% of the participants indicated that they would not ride in a driverless car, and 87% favor a requirement of having a human in the driverâ€™s seat in case of an emergency.14 Suppose that the number of participants was n = 500. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that more than a simple majority of Americans would not ride in a driverless car?
a. Use a formal test of hypothesis with a 5.05 to determine  whether more than 50% of Americans would  not ride in a driverless car.  
b. Use the p-value approach. Do the two approaches  lead to the same conclusion?
