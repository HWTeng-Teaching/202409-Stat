p-Values Find the p-values for the z-tests in Exercises 11–13 and determine the significance of the results.  
11. A right-tailed test with observed z = 1.15.  
12. A two-tailed test with observed z = 22.78.  
13. A left-tailed test with observed z = 21.81.

To find the p-values for the z-tests and determine the significance of the results, we use the z-distribution. Here’s how to calculate the p-values:

11. A right-tailed test with observed z = 1.15
1.	Find the p-value:
The p-value is the area to the right of z=1.15z = 1.15z=1.15. Using a z-table or statistical software:  
p=P(Z>1.15)=1−P(Z≤1.15)
From the z-table: (Z≤1.15)≈0.8749
So: p=1−0.8749=0.1251

2.	Significance:  
Compare the p-value to the significance level ($$\alpha$$, often 0.05).  
Since 0.1251>0.050.1251 > 0.050.1251>0.05, the result is not significant.

12. A two-tailed test with observed z = 22.78  
1.	Find the p-value:  
For a two-tailed test, the p-value is:  p=2×P(Z>22.78)  
For z=22.78, the probability is essentially 0 (extremely small).  
So:  p≈2×0=0

2.	Significance:  
Since p=0<0.05, the result is highly significant.

----
13. A left-tailed test with observed z = 21.81
1.	Find the p-value:
For a left-tailed test, the p-value is:p=P(Z<21.81)
For z=21.81, the probability is effectively 1 (extremely close to 1).
So: p≈1

2.	Significance:
Since p=1>0.05, the result is not significant.

----
Summary:
•	Exercise 11: p = 0.1251 (not significant).
•	Exercise 12: p = 0 (highly significant).
•	Exercise 13: p = 1 (not significant).
