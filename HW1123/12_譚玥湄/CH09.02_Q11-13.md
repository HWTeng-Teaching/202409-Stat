11. A right-tailed test with observed z = 1.15.  
12. A two-tailed test with observed z = 22.78.  
13. A left-tailed test with observed z = 21.81.

To find the p-values for the z-tests and determine the significance of the results, we use the z-distribution. Here’s how to calculate the p-values:

11. A right-tailed test with observed z = 1.15

step 1.	Find the p-value:  
The p-value is the area to the right of  z=1.15. Using a z-table or statistical software:   
p=P(Z>1.15)=1−P(Z≤1.15)  
From the z-table: (Z≤1.15)≈0.8749  
So: p=1−0.8749=0.1251  

step 2.	Significance:   
Compare the p-value to the significance level ($$\alpha$$, often 0.05).  
Since p=0.1251 , $$alpha$$ =0.05 , p > $$\alpha$$, the result is not significant.

12. A two-tailed test with observed z = 22.78

step 1.	Find the p-value:   
For a two-tailed test, the p-value is:  p=2×P (Z>22.78)  
For z=22.78, the probability is essentially 0 (extremely small).  
So:  p≈2×0=0  

step 2.	Significance:  
Since p=0 ,$$\alpha$$ =0.05 , p < $$\alpha$$ , the result is highly significant.  

----  
13. A left-tailed test with observed z = 21.81
    
step 1.	Find the p-value:  
For a left-tailed test, the p-value is:p=P(Z<21.81)  
For z=21.81, the probability is effectively 1 (extremely close to 1).  
So: p≈1  

step 2.	Significance:  
Since p=1 ,$$\alpha$$ =0.05, p> $$\alpha$$ the result is not significant.  

----  
Summary:  
•	Exercise 11: p = 0.1251 (not significant).  
•	Exercise 12: p = 0 (highly significant).  
•	Exercise 13: p = 1 (not significant).
