10. Plant Genetics A peony plant with red petals was
crossed with another plant having streaky petals. A
geneticist states that 75% of the offspring resulting from
this cross will have red flowers. To test this claim, 100
seeds from this cross were collected and germinated,
and 58 plants had red petals.
a. What hypothesis should you use to test the geneticistâ€™s
claim?
b. Calculate the test statistic and its p-value. Use the
p-value to evaluate the statistical significance of the
results at the 1% level.
