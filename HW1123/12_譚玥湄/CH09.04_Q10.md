CH09.04_Q10  
10. Plant Genetics A peony plant with red petals was crossed with another plant having streaky petals. A geneticist states that 75% of the offspring resulting from this cross will have red flowers. To test this claim, 100
seeds from this cross were collected and germinated, and 58 plants had red petals.  
a. What hypothesis should you use to test the geneticist’s claim?  
b. Calculate the test statistic and its p-value. Use the p-value to evaluate the statistical significance of the results at the 1% level.

We will perform a hypothesis test to evaluate the geneticist's claim that 75% of the offspring from the cross will have red flowers. Here's the detailed solution:
________________________________________
(1) H0 : p = 0.75 Ha : p ≠ 0.75 
(2) set α = 0.01 (3)計算檢定統計量: p^＝58/100=0.58 , Z = (p^- p)/( √(p*(1-p)/n )) = 0.58−0.75/( √(0.75*0.25/100 ))= -3.9260
(4) P-Value = 2*p(Z>|-3.93|)=0 
(5) P-value 0 < α = 0.05，故拒絕虛無假設，有證據顯示p ≠ 0.75，
(6)即意味著樣本的紅花比例與遺傳學家所聲稱的75%顯著不同。

Conclusion
Since the p-value is less than 0.010.010.01, we reject the null hypothesis (H0H_0H0) at the 1% significance level. This means the data provide strong evidence to refute the geneticist's claim that 75% of the offspring have red flowers.
