Identifying Parts of a Test Use the information in Exercises 1–3. State the null and alternative hypotheses;calculate the appropriate test statistic; provide an $$\alpha$$ =.05 rejection region; and state your conclusions.  
1. A random sample of n = 1000 from a binomial population contained 279 successes. You wish to show that p < .3.  
2. A random sample of n = 1400 observations from a binomial population produced x5529 successes. You wish to show that p differs from .4.  
3. Seventy-two successes were observed in a random sample of n = 120 observations from a binomial population. You wish to show that p > .5.

Here’s the solution for each of the three problems step by step:
________________________________________
Problem 1
Hypotheses
•	Null Hypothesis (H0H_0H0): p=0.3p = 0.3p=0.3 (The population proportion is 0.3.)
•	Alternative Hypothesis (HaH_aHa): p<0.3p < 0.3p<0.3 (The population proportion is less than 0.3.)
Test Statistic
For a binomial proportion test, the test statistic is given by:
z=p^−p0p0(1−p0)nz = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}z=np0(1−p0)p^−p0
Where:
•	p^=xn=2791000=0.279\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{279}{1000} = 0.279p^=nx=1000279=0.279,
•	p0=0.3p_0 = 0.3p0=0.3,
•	n=1000n = 1000n=1000.
Calculate the standard error (SESESE):
SE=p0(1−p0)n=0.3(1−0.3)1000=0.3⋅0.71000≈0.01449SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.3(1 - 0.3)}{1000}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.3 \cdot 0.7}{1000}} \approx 0.01449SE=np0(1−p0)=10000.3(1−0.3)=10000.3⋅0.7≈0.01449
Calculate zzz:
z=p^−p0SE=0.279−0.30.01449≈−0.0210.01449≈−1.45z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE} = \frac{0.279 - 0.3}{0.01449} \approx \frac{-0.021}{0.01449} \approx -1.45z=SEp^−p0=0.014490.279−0.3≈0.01449−0.021≈−1.45
Rejection Region
For a one-tailed test at α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05, the critical zzz-value is −1.645-1.645−1.645.
•	Reject H0H_0H0 if z<−1.645z < -1.645z<−1.645.
Since z=−1.45z = -1.45z=−1.45 is not less than −1.645-1.645−1.645, fail to reject H0H_0H0.
Conclusion
At the 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that p<0.3p < 0.3p<0.3.

Problem 2
Hypotheses
•	Null Hypothesis (H0H_0H0): p=0.4p = 0.4p=0.4 (The population proportion is 0.4.)
•	Alternative Hypothesis (HaH_aHa): p≠0.4p \neq 0.4p=0.4 (The population proportion differs from 0.4.)
Test Statistic
p^=xn=5291400≈0.37786\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{529}{1400} \approx 0.37786p^=nx=1400529≈0.37786
Calculate the standard error (SESESE):
SE=p0(1−p0)n=0.4(1−0.4)1400=0.4⋅0.61400≈0.01307SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.4(1 - 0.4)}{1400}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.4 \cdot 0.6}{1400}} \approx 0.01307SE=np0(1−p0)=14000.4(1−0.4)=14000.4⋅0.6≈0.01307
Calculate zzz:
z=p^−p0SE=0.37786−0.40.01307≈−0.022140.01307≈−1.69z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE} = \frac{0.37786 - 0.4}{0.01307} \approx \frac{-0.02214}{0.01307} \approx -1.69z=SEp^−p0=0.013070.37786−0.4≈0.01307−0.02214≈−1.69
Rejection Region
For a two-tailed test at α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05, the critical zzz-values are ±1.96\pm 1.96±1.96.
•	Reject H0H_0H0 if z<−1.96z < -1.96z<−1.96 or z>1.96z > 1.96z>1.96.
Since z=−1.69z = -1.69z=−1.69 is not in the rejection region, fail to reject H0H_0H0.
Conclusion
At the 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that ppp differs from 0.4.

Problem 3
Hypotheses
•	Null Hypothesis (H0H_0H0): p=0.5p = 0.5p=0.5 (The population proportion is 0.5.)
•	Alternative Hypothesis (HaH_aHa): p>0.5p > 0.5p>0.5 (The population proportion is greater than 0.5.)
Test Statistic
p^=xn=72120=0.6\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{72}{120} = 0.6p^=nx=12072=0.6
Calculate the standard error (SESESE):
SE=p0(1−p0)n=0.5(1−0.5)120=0.5⋅0.5120≈0.04564SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1 - 0.5)}{120}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{120}} \approx 0.04564SE=np0(1−p0)=1200.5(1−0.5)=1200.5⋅0.5≈0.04564
Calculate zzz:
z=p^−p0SE=0.6−0.50.04564≈0.10.04564≈2.19z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE} = \frac{0.6 - 0.5}{0.04564} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.04564} \approx 2.19z=SEp^−p0=0.045640.6−0.5≈0.045640.1≈2.19
Rejection Region
For a one-tailed test at α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05, the critical zzz-value is 1.6451.6451.645.
•	Reject H0H_0H0 if z>1.645z > 1.645z>1.645.
Since z=2.19>1.645z = 2.19 > 1.645z=2.19>1.645, reject H0H_0H0.
Conclusion
At the 5% significance level, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that p>0.5p > 0.5p>0.5.
