Exercise 8: A left-tailed test with \alpha =.01.
1.	Rejection Region:
  --	For a left-tailed test at α=0.01\alpha = 0.01α=0.01, the critical value is z=−2.33z = -2.33z=−2.33.
  --	Reject H0H_0H0 if z≤−2.33z \leq -2.33z≤−2.33.
2.	Observed Test Statistic:
  --	z=−2.41z = -2.41z=−2.41, which is less than −2.33-2.33−2.33.
3.	Conclusion:
  --	zzz falls in the rejection region. Reject H0H_0H0.
  --	There is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (HaH_aHa).
4.	Measure of Reliability (p-value):
  --	The p-value for z=−2.41z = -2.41z=−2.41 is approximately 0.0080.0080.008, which is less than 0.010.010.01. This supports the conclusion.

Exercise 9: Left-tailed test with α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05
1.	Rejection Region:
  --	For a left-tailed test at α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05, the critical value is z=−1.645z = -1.645z=−1.645.
  --	Reject H0H_0H0 if z≤−1.645z \leq -1.645z≤−1.645.
2.	Observed Test Statistic:
  --	z=−2.41z = -2.41z=−2.41, which is less than −1.645-1.645−1.645.
3.	Conclusion:
  --	zzz falls in the rejection region. Reject H0H_0H0.
  --	There is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (HaH_aHa).
4.	Measure of Reliability (p-value):
  --	The p-value for z=−2.41z = -2.41z=−2.41 is approximately 0.0080.0080.008, which is less than 0.050.050.05. This supports the conclusion.

Exercise 10: Two-tailed test with α=0.02\alpha = 0.02α=0.02
1.	Rejection Region:
  --	For a two-tailed test at α=0.02\alpha = 0.02α=0.02, the critical values are z=±2.33z = \pm 2.33z=±2.33.
  --	Reject H0H_0H0 if z≤−2.33z \leq -2.33z≤−2.33 or z≥2.33z \geq 2.33z≥2.33.
2.	Observed Test Statistic:
  --	z=−2.41z = -2.41z=−2.41, which is less than −2.33-2.33−2.33.
3.	Conclusion:
  --	zzz falls in the rejection region. Reject H0H_0H0.
  --	There is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (HaH_aHa).
4.	Measure of Reliability (p-value):
  --	The p-value for z=−2.41z = -2.41z=−2.41 in a two-tailed test is approximately 0.0160.0160.016, which is less than 0.020.020.02. This supports the conclusion.
