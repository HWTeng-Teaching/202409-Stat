20. Cerebral Blood Flow Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brains of healthy people is normally distributed with a mean of 74. A random sample of 25 stroke patients resulted in an average CBF of x =69.7 with a standard deviation of s = 16. Test the hypothesis that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people using a =.05.
