20. Cerebral Blood Flow Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in
the brains of healthy people is normally distributed with
a mean of 74. A random sample of 25 stroke patients
resulted in an average CBF of x 569.7 with a standard
deviation of s516. Test the hypothesis that the average
CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy
people using a 5.05.
