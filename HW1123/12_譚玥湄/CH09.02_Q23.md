23. Hamburger Meat Ground beef is packaged in small trays, intended to hold 1 pound of meat. A random sample of 35 packages in the small tray produced weight measurements with an average of 1.01 pounds and a standard deviation of .18 pound.  
a. If you were the quality control manager and wanted to make sure that the average amount of ground beef was indeed 1 pound, what hypotheses would you test?  
b. Find the p-value for the test and use it to perform the test in part a.  
c. How would you, as the quality control manager, report the results of your study to a consumer interest group?

a. Hypotheses  
To test whether the average amount of ground beef in the small trays is 1 pound, we set up the following hypotheses:  
•	Null hypothesis (H0H_0H0): The average weight is equal to 1 pound (μ=1).  
•	Alternative hypothesis (HaH_aHa): The average weight is not equal to 1 pound (μ / 1).  
This is a two-tailed test, as we are testing for deviation in either direction.

b. Find the p-value and perform the test  
1.	Calculate the test statistic:  
The test statistic for a one-sample ttt-test is calculated using the formula:   t=nsxˉ−μ
Where:  
o	xˉ=1.01 (sample mean)  
o	μ=1 (hypothesized mean)  
o	s=0.18 (sample standard deviation)  
o	n=35 (sample size)  

Substituting the values:  t=350.181.01−1=0.03040.01≈0.33  

3.	Degrees of freedom: Degrees of freedom (df) = n−1 = 35−1 = 34.  

4.	Find the p-value:  
Using a ttt-distribution table or statistical software, the two-tailed p-value for t=0.33 with df=34 is approximately:  p≈0.745  

5.	Perform the test:  
Compare ppp-value to the significance level (α=0.05). Since 0.745>0.050.745 > 0.050.745>0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.   
There is no significant evidence to suggest the average weight is different from 1 pound.

c. Report the results to a consumer interest group  
"As part of our quality control measures, we conducted a statistical analysis of the average weight of ground beef packaged in small trays, which are intended to hold 1 pound of meat. Based on a random sample of 35 packages, the average weight was 1.01 pounds with a standard deviation of 0.18 pounds. Statistical testing indicated no significant difference from the intended weight of 1 pound (t=0.33, p=0.745). This suggests that the packaging process is consistent with the stated weight. We will continue monitoring production to maintain this standard."
