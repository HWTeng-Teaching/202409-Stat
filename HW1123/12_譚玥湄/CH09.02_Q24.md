CH09.02_Q24 
O Baby! The weights of 3-month-old baby girls are known to have a mean of 5.86 kilograms.2 Doctors at an inner city pediatric facility suspect that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at their facility may be less than 5.86 kilograms. They select a random sample of 40 3-month-old baby girls and find x =5.56 and s=0.70 kilogram.  
a. Does the data indicate that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at their facility is less than 5.86 kilograms? Test using $$\alpha$$ = .05.  
b. What is the p-value associated with the test in part a? Can you reject $$H_0$$ at the 5% level of significance using the p-value?

2. Determine the Test Statistic:  
The formula for the ttt-statistic is: t=s/nxˉ−μ  
Where:  
•	xˉ=5.56\bar{x} = 5.56xˉ=5.56 (sample mean)  
•	μ=5.86 (population mean under H0H_0H0)  
•	0s=0.70 (sample standard deviation)  
•	n=40 (sample size)  
3. Substitute the Values:
t=5.56−5.860.70/40=−0.300.1107≈−2.71t = \frac{5.56 - 5.86}{0.70 / \sqrt{40}} = \frac{-0.30}{0.1107} \approx -2.71t=0.70/405.56−5.86=0.1107−0.30≈−2.71
4. Find the Critical Value:
With α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05 and degrees of freedom (df=n−1=39df = n - 1 = 39df=n−1=39), the critical value for a one-tailed ttt-test can be obtained from a ttt-distribution table or software. The critical ttt-value is approximately -1.685.

5. Decision Rule:  
•	Reject H0H_0H0 if t≤−1.685.  
Sincet=−2.71 is less than −1.685, we reject H0H_0H0.  
Conclusion for Part (a):  
The data indicates that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at the facility is significantly less than 5.86 kilograms at the 5% significance level.

Part (b): Find the p-value
The p-value corresponds to the area under the ttt-distribution curve to the left of t=−2.71 with df=39.  
Using statistical software or a ttt-distribution table:  
•	The p-value for tt=−2.71 with df=39 is approximately 0.005.  
Decision Based on the p-value:
•	If the p-value ≤α\leq \alpha≤α, reject H0H_0H0.
•	Since p=0.005<0.05, we reject H0H_0H0.
Conclusion for Part (b):
The p-value confirms that we can reject H0H_0H0 at the 5% significance level. The evidence strongly suggests that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at the facility is less than 5.86 kilograms.
