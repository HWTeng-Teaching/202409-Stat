CH09.02_Q24 
Baby! The weights of 3-month-old baby girls are known to have a mean of 5.86 kilograms.2 Doctors at an inner city pediatric facility suspect that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at their facility may be less than 5.86 kilograms. They select a random sample of 40 3-month-old baby girls and find x =5.56 and s=0.70 kilogram.  
a. Does the data indicate that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at their facility is less than 5.86 kilograms? Test using $$\alpha$$ = .05.  
b. What is the p-value associated with the test in part a? Can you reject $$H_0$$ at the 5% level of significance using the p-value?

Step-by-Step Solution
Part (a): Hypothesis Test

1.	State the hypotheses:
o	Null Hypothesis ($$H_0$$): μ=5.86 (The mean weight is 5.86 kg.)
o	Alternative Hypothesis ($$H_a$$): μ<5.86 (The mean weight is less than 5.86 kg.)
This is a left-tailed test.

2. Determine the Test Statistic:  
The formula for the ttt-statistic is:

Where:  
•	$$\overline{x}$$=5.56 (sample mean)  
•	μ=5.86 (population mean under H0H_0H0)  
•	s=0.70 (sample standard deviation)  
•	n=40 (sample size)  

4. Substitute the Values:

5. Find the Critical Value:
With α=0.05 and degrees of freedom (df=n−1=39), the critical value for a one-tailed t-test can be obtained from a t-distribution table or software. The critical t-value is approximately -1.685.

6. Decision Rule:  
•	Reject $$H_0$$ if t≤−1.685.  
Since t=−2.71 is less than −1.685, we reject $$H_0$$.

Part (b): Find the p-value
The p-value corresponds to the area under the ttt-distribution curve to the left of t=−2.71 with df=39.  
Using statistical software or a ttt-distribution table:  
•	The p-value for tt=−2.71 with df=39 is approximately 0.005. 

Decision Based on the p-value:
•	If the p-value ≤α, reject $$H_0$$ , Since p=0.005<0.05, we reject $$H_0$$.

Conclusion for Part (b):
The p-value confirms that we can reject H0H_0H0 at the 5% significance level. The evidence strongly suggests that the average weight of 3-month-old baby girls at the facility is less than 5.86 kilograms.
