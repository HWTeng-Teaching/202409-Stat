CH09.02_Q25.  
Potency of an Antibiotic A drug manufacturer claimed that the mean potency of one of its antibiotics was 80%. A random sample of n=100 capsules was tested and produced a sample mean of x =79.7% with
a standard deviation of s=.8%. Do the data present sufficient evidence to refute the manufacturer’s claim? Let $$\alpha$$ =.05.  
a. State the null hypothesis to be tested.  
b. State the alternative hypothesis.  
c. Conduct a statistical test of the null hypothesis and state your conclusion.

We are testing whether the data provide sufficient evidence to refute the manufacturer’s claim that the mean potency of the antibiotic is 80%. Here's the solution step-by-step:
________________________________________
Part (a): State the Null Hypothesis
The null hypothesis assumes the manufacturer's claim is correct:
H0:μ=80H_0: \mu = 80H0:μ=80
________________________________________
Part (b): State the Alternative Hypothesis
The alternative hypothesis reflects the suspicion that the mean potency is not equal to 80%:
Ha:μ≠80H_a: \mu \neq 80Ha:μ=80
This is a two-tailed test.
________________________________________
Part (c): Conduct the Statistical Test
We will use a ttt-test because the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is n=100n = 100n=100, which is sufficiently large.
Step 1: Test Statistic Formula
The test statistic is calculated as:
t=xˉ−μs/nt = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}t=s/nxˉ−μ
Where:
•	xˉ=79.7\bar{x} = 79.7xˉ=79.7 (sample mean),
•	μ=80\mu = 80μ=80 (population mean under H0H_0H0),
•	s=0.8s = 0.8s=0.8 (sample standard deviation),
•	n=100n = 100n=100 (sample size).
________________________________________
Step 2: Compute the Test Statistic
Substitute the values into the formula:
t=79.7−800.8/100=−0.30.08=−3.75t = \frac{79.7 - 80}{0.8 / \sqrt{100}} = \frac{-0.3}{0.08} = -3.75t=0.8/10079.7−80=0.08−0.3=−3.75
________________________________________
Step 3: Determine the Critical Value
For a two-tailed test at α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05 and degrees of freedom (df=n−1=99df = n - 1 = 99df=n−1=99), the critical ttt-values can be found using a ttt-distribution table or software:
t∗=±1.984t^* = \pm 1.984t∗=±1.984
________________________________________
Step 4: Compare Test Statistic and Critical Value
•	If t≤−1.984t \leq -1.984t≤−1.984 or t≥1.984t \geq 1.984t≥1.984, reject H0H_0H0.
•	Since t=−3.75<−1.984t = -3.75 < -1.984t=−3.75<−1.984, we reject H0H_0H0.
________________________________________
Conclusion:
The test statistic falls in the rejection region. Therefore, at the 5% significance level, there is sufficient evidence to refute the manufacturer's claim that the mean potency of the antibiotic is 80%.

Additional Context
Practical Interpretation:
The sample data suggest that the actual mean potency of the antibiotic is significantly different from 80%. This discrepancy could indicate a quality control issue that requires further investigation.
