Early Detection of Breast Cancer Of those women who are diagnosed to have early-stage breast cancer, one-third eventually die of the disease. Suppose a screening program for the early detection of breast cancer was started in order to increase the survival rate p of those diagnosed to have the disease. A random sample of 200 women was selected from among those who were screened by the program and who were diagnosed to have the disease. Let x represent the number of those in the sample who survive the disease.  
a. If you wish to determine whether the screening program has been effective, state the alternative hypothesis that should be tested.  
b. State the null hypothesis.  
c. If 164 women in the sample of 200 survive the disease,can you conclude that the screening program was effective? Test using $$\alpha$$ = .05 and explain the practical conclusions from your test.  
d. Find the p-value for the test and interpret it.

We are testing whether a screening program has increased the survival rate (p) of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Here’s the solution step-by-step:
________________________________________
Part (a): State the Alternative Hypothesis
The alternative hypothesis reflects the claim that the survival rate (p) has increased due to the screening program. Since historically p=13=0.333, the alternative hypothesis is:
Ha:p>0.333

Part (b): State the Null Hypothesis
The null hypothesis assumes no effect from the screening program, meaning the survival rate remains the same as the historical rate:
H0:p=0.333
________________________________________
Part (c): Conduct the Hypothesis Test
To test if the screening program is effective, we use a one-tailed z-test for a population proportion. The test statistic is given by:
z=p^−p0p0(1−p0)nz = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}z=np0(1−p0)p^−p0
Where:
•	p^=xn=164200=0.82\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{164}{200} = 0.82p^=nx=200164=0.82 (sample proportion),
•	p0=0.333 (population proportion under H0H_0H0),
•	n=200 (sample size).
Step 1: Calculate the Standard Error
SE=p0(1−p0)n=0.333(1−0.333)200=0.333⋅0.667200≈0.0335SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.333 (1 - 0.333)}{200}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.333 \cdot 0.667}{200}} \approx 0.0335SE=np0(1−p0)=2000.333(1−0.333)=2000.333⋅0.667≈0.0335
Step 2: Compute the Test Statistic
z=p^−p0SE=0.82−0.3330.0335≈0.4870.0335≈14.54z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE} = \frac{0.82 - 0.333}{0.0335} \approx \frac{0.487}{0.0335} \approx 14.54z=SEp^−p0=0.03350.82−0.333≈0.03350.487≈14.54
Step 3: Find the Critical Value
For a one-tailed test at α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05, the critical zzz-value is:
z∗=1.645z^* = 1.645z∗=1.645
Step 4: Compare Test Statistic and Critical Value
Since z=14.54>1.645, we reject H0H_0H0.
Conclusion:
There is strong evidence that the screening program has increased the survival rate of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.
________________________________________
Part (d): Find the p-value
The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one computed, assuming H0H_0H0 is true. For z=14.54, the p-value is virtually 000 (approaches 10−4710^{-47}10−47), which is far smaller than α=0.05\alpha = 0.05α=0.05.
Interpretation:
The p-value indicates overwhelming evidence against H0H_0H0. Practically, this means the screening program is highly effective at improving the survival rate.

Summary of Results:
•	H0H_0H0:p=0.333, HaH_aHa:p>0.333.
•	Test statistic: z=14.54.
•	Critical value: z∗=1.645.
•	P-value: Approaches 000.
•	Conclusion: Reject H0H_0H0. The screening program significantly improves the survival rate of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.
