# CH09.04_Q01-03 #

State the null and alternative hypotheses;
calculate the appropriate test statistic; provide an $\alpha$ = .05 rejection region;
and state your conclusions.







A random sample of size n from a binomail population to test

$H_0: p = p_0$ versus

$H_a: one of three alternatives$

Test statsitics: z = $\frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0 q_0}{n}}}$

with rejection regions and/or p-values based on the standard normal z distribution
