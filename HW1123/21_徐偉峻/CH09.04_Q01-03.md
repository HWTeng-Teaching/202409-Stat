State the null and alternative hypotheses; 陳述虛無假設和對立假設

calculate the appropriate test statistic; 計算出適當的檢定統計量

provide an $\alpha$ = .05 rejection region; 提供顯著水準 (significance level) $\alpha$ = .05 的拒絕域

and state your conclusions. 陳述結論

1. A random sample of n = 1000 from a binomial population contained 279 successes.
You wish to show that p < .3.

2. A random sample of n = 1400 observations from a binomial population produced x = 529 successes.
You wish to show that p differs from .4.

3. Seventy-two successes were observed in a random sample of n = 120 observations from a binomial population.
You wish to show that p > .5.





A random sample of size n from a binomail population to test

$H_0: p = p_0$ versus

$H_a: one of three alternatives$

Test statsitics: z = $\frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0 q_0}{n}}}$

with rejection regions and/or p-values based on the standard normal z distribution
