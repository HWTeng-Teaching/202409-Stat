***Ride in a Driverless Car?***

***In a Pew Research report concerning the rise of automation in the United States, 56% of the participants indicated that they would not ride in a driverless car, and 87% favor a requirement of having a human in the driver’s seat in case of an emergency. Suppose that the number of participants was n=500. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that more than a simple majority of Americans would not ride in a driverless car?***
 
***a.  Use a formal test of hypothesis with α = 0.05 to determine whether more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car.***

>**1.Define Hypotheses:**
><br/>
>
>$$H_0$$ : $P = 0.5$
>(exactly half of Americans would not ride in a driverless car).
> 
>$$H_a$$ : $P > 0.5$
> (more than half of Americans would not ride in a driverless car).

>Sample proportion $$\hat{P} =0.56 $$

>Population proportion under $H_0$ $(p0)$ $= 0.50$

>Sample size $(N) = 500

>𝑍 = $$\frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0 q_0}{n}}} $$ = $$\frac{0.56 - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5 * 0.5}{500}}} $$ $\approx$ 1.899 > 1.645

>For a one-tailed test at $$\alpha $$ = 0.05, the critical 𝑍-value is 1.645.

***b. Use the p-value approach. Do the two approaches lead to the same conclusion?***
    
>**1.Find the 𝑝-Value**

>Using standard normal distribution tables , $P( Z > 1.899) $\approx$ 0.0288

>**2.Compare 𝑝-Value with 𝛼**

>$p = 0.0288 < 0.05$: Reject $$H_0$$。

>**3.Conclusion:**

>*The 𝑝-value approach leads to the same conclusion: there is sufficient evidence to suggest that more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car.*
