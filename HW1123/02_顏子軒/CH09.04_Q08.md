***Ride in a Driverless Car?***

***In a Pew Research report concerning the rise of automation in the United States, 56% of the participants indicated that they would not ride in a driverless car, and 87% favor a requirement of having a human in the driver’s seat in case of an emergency. Suppose that the number of participants was n=500. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that more than a simple majority of Americans would not ride in a driverless car?***
 
***a.  Use a formal test of hypothesis with α = 0.05 to determine whether more than 50% of Americans would not ride in a driverless car.***

***b. Use the p-value approach. Do the two approaches lead to the same conclusion?***

>$$H_a$$ : P > 0.5 (右尾檢定)

>已知條件 : n=500, $$\hat{P} =0.56 $$, n*p=250 且 n*(1-p)=250 $$\ge $$ 5，由小題a.得知Z值接近2.68。
