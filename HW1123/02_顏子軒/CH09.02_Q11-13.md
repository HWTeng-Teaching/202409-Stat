## Find the p-value for the z-tests and determine the significance of the results.

### 11. A right-tailed test with observed z = 1.15

$P(z \gt 1.15) = 1 - P(z \lt 1.15) = 1 - 0.8749 = 0.1251$  

If $\alpha \gt 0.1251$, $H_{0}$ is rejected  
If $\alpha \lt 0.1251$, $H_{0}$ is not rejected  

The p-value is greater than 0.1, $H_{0}$ is not rejected. The results are **not statistically significant**.

### 12. A two-tailed test with observed z = -2.78

$P(z \lt -2.78) = 0.0027$  
$P(z \gt 2.78) = 0.0027$  
For a two tailed test, the total p-value = $2 \times 0.0027 = 0.0054$  

If $\alpha \lt 0.0054$, $H_{0}$ is rejected  
If $\alpha \gt 0.0054$, $H_{0}$ is not rejected

The p-value is less than 0.01, $H_{0}$ is rejected. The results are **highly significant**.

### 13. A left-tailed test with observed z = -1.81

$P(z \lt -1.81) = 0.0351$  

If $\alpha \gt 0.0351$, $H_{0}$ is rejected  
If $\alpha \lt 0.0351$, $H_{0}$ is not rejected

The p-value is between 0.01 and 0.05, $H_{0}$ is rejected. The results are **statistically significant**.
