8. A left-tailed test with 
𝛼
=
0.01
α=0.01
Rejection region: For a left-tailed test, the critical value corresponds to 
𝑧
𝛼
z 
α
​
 , where 
𝑃
(
𝑍
≤
𝑧
𝛼
)
=
0.01
P(Z≤z 
α
​
 )=0.01. Using a standard normal table, 
𝑧
𝛼
≈
−
2.33
z 
α
​
 ≈−2.33.
Decision: Since 
𝑧
=
−
2.41
z=−2.41 is less than 
𝑧
𝛼
=
−
2.33
z 
α
​
 =−2.33, we reject the null hypothesis.
Reliability: The 
𝑝
p-value for 
𝑧
=
−
2.41
z=−2.41 is approximately 
0.0080
0.0080, which is less than 
𝛼
=
0.01
α=0.01. This supports the decision.
9. A left-tailed test with 
𝛼
=
0.05
α=0.05
Rejection region: For 
𝛼
=
0.05
α=0.05, 
𝑧
𝛼
≈
−
1.645
z 
α
​
 ≈−1.645.
Decision: Since 
𝑧
=
−
2.41
z=−2.41 is less than 
𝑧
𝛼
=
−
1.645
z 
α
​
 =−1.645, we reject the null hypothesis.
Reliability: The 
𝑝
p-value (
≈
0.0080
≈0.0080) is also less than 
𝛼
=
0.05
α=0.05, confirming the conclusion.
10. A two-tailed test with 
𝛼
=
0.02
α=0.02
Rejection region: For a two-tailed test, split 
𝛼
α into two tails (
𝛼
/
2
=
0.01
α/2=0.01):
Critical values are 
𝑧
=
±
2.33
z=±2.33.
Decision: Since 
𝑧
=
−
2.41
z=−2.41 is less than 
−
2.33
−2.33, it falls in the rejection region. We reject the null hypothesis.
Reliability: The 
𝑝
p-value for a two-tailed test is 
2
×
𝑃
(
𝑍
≤
−
2.41
)
≈
2
×
0.0080
=
0.016
2×P(Z≤−2.41)≈2×0.0080=0.016, which is less than 
𝛼
=
0.02
α=0.02, supporting the conclusion.
