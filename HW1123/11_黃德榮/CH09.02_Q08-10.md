8. A left-tailed test with α=0.01

•	Rejection region: For a left-tailed test, the critical value corresponds to zα, where P(Z≤zα)=0.01. Using a standard normal table, zα≈−2.33.

•	Decision: Since z=−2.41 is less than zα=−2.33, we reject the H0 hypothesis.

•	Reliability: The p-value for z=−2.41is approximately 0.00800.00800.0080, which is less than α=0.01. This supports the decision.

9. A left-tailed test with α=0.05
    
•	Rejection region: For α=0.05, zα≈−1.64.

•	Decision: Since z=−2.41 is less than zα=−1.645, we reject the H0 hypothesis.

•	Reliability: The p-value (≈0.0080) is also less than α=0.05, confirming the conclusion.


10. A two-tailed test with α=0.02\alpha = 0.02α=0.02
•	Rejection region: For a two-tailed test, split α into two tails (α/2=0.01):

o	Critical values are z=±2.33.

•	Decision: Since z=−2.41 is less than −2.33, it falls in the rejection region. We reject the H0 hypothesis.

•	Reliability: The p-value for a two-tailed test is 2×P(Z≤−2.41)≈2×0.0080=0.0162, which is less than α=0.02, supporting the conclusion.
