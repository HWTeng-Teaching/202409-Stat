11. A right-tailed test with z=1.1
    
•	Calculation of p-value: For a right-tailed test, the ppp-value is P(Z≥1.15). Using a standard normal table, P(Z≤1.15)≈0.8749. Thus, P(Z≥1.15)=1−0.8749=0.1251.

•	Significance: The p-value (0.1251) is greater than typical significance levels (α=0.05 or α=0.01), so the result is not statistically significant.

12. A two-tailed test with z=−2.78
    
•	Calculation of p-value: For a two-tailed test, the p-value is 2×P(Z≤−2.78). From the normal table, P(Z≤−2.78)≈0.0027. Thus, p=2×0.0027=0.0054.

•	Significance: The p-value (0.0054) is less than α=0.05 and α=0.01, so the result is statistically significant.

13. A left-tailed test with z=−1.81

•	Calculation of p-value: For a left-tailed test, the p-value is P(Z≤−1.81). From the normal table, P(Z≤−1.81)≈0.0351.

•	Significance: The p-value (0.0351) is less than α=0.05 but greater than α=0.01. The result is statistically significant at α=0.05 but not at α=0.01.
