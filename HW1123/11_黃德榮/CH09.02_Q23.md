a. Hypotheses

The quality control manager wants to test if the average amount of ground beef is equal to 1 pound. The hypotheses for this test are:

•	Null hypothesis (H0): The mean weight is 1 pound, μ is equal to 1.

•	Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The mean weight is not 1 pound, μ≠1 (two-tailed test).

b. Calculate the ppp-value and perform the test

1.	Given values:

o	Sample mean (xˉ) = 1.01

o	Hypothesized mean (μ0) = 1

o	Sample standard deviation (s) = 0.18

o	Sample size (n) = 35

2.	Test statistic: The test statistic for a one-sample zzz-test is:
   
z=xˉ−μ0s/nz

Substituting the values:

z=1.01−10.18/35=0.010.0304≈0.33

3.	Find the ppp-value: For a two-tailed test, the ppp-value is:
   
p=2×P(Z≥∣z∣)

From the standard normal table, P(Z≥0.33)≈0.3707. Thus:

p=2×0.3707=0.7414

4.	Decision: At a typical significance level (α=0.05):
   
o	The p-value (0.7414) is much greater than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

o	There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean weight differs from 1 pound.
