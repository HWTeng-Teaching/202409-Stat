Q3 position:0.75(28+1)=21.75

## a.

min: 1.7

max: 485

Q1 is between 118 and 168
Q1 = 118+0.25(168-118) = 130.5

median(M) is between 241 and 252

M = 241+0.5(252-241) = 246.5

Q3 is between 316 and 318
Q3 = 316+0.75(318-316) = 317.5


## b.

IQR = Q3-Q1 = 317.5-130.5 = 187

Upper fence = 317.5+1.5*187 = 598

Lower fence = 130.5-1.5*187 = -150

## c.

There is no outliner.

## d.

Younger dolphins (less than 3 years) might have lower mercury concentrations due to less exposure compared to older dolphins (more than 8 years), which may have accumulated higher levels of mercury over time due to longer exposure to environmental toxins. This biological factor can result in significant differences in the mercury concentrations observed in the two age groups.
