## a.
Q1 position = 0.25(12+1) = 3.25
median position = 0.5(12+1) = 6.5
Q3 position = 0.75(12+1) = 9.75

min:233.97

max:459.21

Q1 = 247.34+0.25(252.44-247.34) = 248.615

median = 273.8+0.5(286.35-273.8) = 280.075

Q3 = 383.68+0.75(408.48-383.68) = 402.28

## b.

The box plot will show the distribution of utility costs. If the box is wide, it indicates variability, while the whiskers' lengths reveal potential outliers. If the median is closer to Q1 or Q3, it suggests skewness in the data. In this case, you may find a right-skewed distribution due to higher utility bills in some months.
