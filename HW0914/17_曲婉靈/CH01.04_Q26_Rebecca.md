## a.
|Age|Frequency|Relative Frequency|
|-|-|-|
|30 to under 35|12|24%|
|35 to under 40|15|30%|
|40 to under 45|12|24%|
|45 to under 50|8|16%|
|50 to under 55|2|4%|

## b.
Proportion = Relative Frequency of 35 to under 40 + Relative Frequency of 40 to under 45 = 30%+24% = 54%

## c.
P(age<50) = 1 - P(age>50) = 1 -(4%+2%) = 94%
