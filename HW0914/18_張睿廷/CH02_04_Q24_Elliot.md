### b. What does the box plot tell you about

The box plot shows the following:

- Range: The utility costs vary between approximately $230 and $460, indicating a significant difference in costs between the least and most expensive months.
- Median: The median monthly cost is slightly below $300, suggesting that half of the months have utility bills above this value and half below.
- IQR (Interquartile Range): The middle 50% of the months have utility costs between about $250 and $400. This indicates that the majority of the bills cluster within this range.
- Outliers or Extremes: The maximum values, such as July at $459.21, suggest that summer months might have higher utility bills, likely due to air conditioning or other seasonal factors.
- The box plot highlights variability in the costs, with a potential seasonal pattern where summer months (like July and September) tend to have higher bills.
