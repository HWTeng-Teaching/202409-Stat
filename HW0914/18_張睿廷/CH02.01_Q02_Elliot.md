## Data Set 2: ( 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 4, 3, 5 )

### Mean Calculation:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{3 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
$$

### Median Calculation:
Ordered Data: 

$$
2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6
$$

Since there are 8 values, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values.

$$
\text{Median} = \frac{4 + 4}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

### Mode Calculation:

The numbers 3, 4, and 5 all appear twice, making them all modes.

$$
\text{Mode} = 3, 4, 5
$$

### Dot Plot:
