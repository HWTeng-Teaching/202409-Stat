### a. Calculate the Range

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data:

$\text{Range} = \max(\text{data}) - \min(\text{data}) = 71 - 40 = 31$

### b. Calculate the Mean $\bar{x}$ and Standard Deviation $s$

#### The mean $\bar{x}$ is calculated as follows:

$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{x_i}}{n} = \frac{49 + 70 + 54 + 67 + 59 + 40 + 61 + 69 + 71 + 52}{10} = 59.2$

#### The standard deviation $s$ is calculated as follows:

$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}} \approx 10.37$

---

### c. How many standard deviations is the range?

The range in terms of standard deviations is:

$\frac{\text{Range}}{s} = \frac{31}{10.37} \approx 2.99$
