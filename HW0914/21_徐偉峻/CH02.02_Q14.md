# CH02.02_Q14 #
A count of the number of bacteria (per 100 milliliters) in 10 portions seawater gave these readings:
49, 70, 54, 67, 59, 40, 61, 69, 71, 52
a. Calculate the range. The range, R, of a set of n measurements is the difference between the largest and smallest measurements.
Arrange the data in ascending order. Sort: 40, 49, 52, 54, 59, 61, 67, 69, 70, 71
R=Maximum-Minimum=71-40=31

b.Calculate $$ \bar{X} $$
