# CH02.04_Q20 #
The mercury concentrations (micrograms/gram) in the livers of 28 male striped dolphins were as follow:

| 1.70 | 183.00 | 221.00 | 286.00 |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1.72 | 168.00 | 406.00 | 315.00 |
| 8.80 | 218.00 | 252.00 | 241.00 |
| 5.90 | 180.00 | 329.00 | 397.00 |
|101.00 | 264.00 | 316.00 | 209.00 |
|85.40 | 481.00 | 445.00 | 314.00 |
|118.00 | 485.00 | 278.00 | 318.00 |

n=28, Sort: 1.70, 1.72, 5.90, 8.80, 85.40, 101.00, 118.00, 168.00, 180.00, 183.00, 209.00, 218.00 221.00, 241.00, 252.00, 264.00, 278.00 286.00, 314.00, 315.00, 316.00, 318.00, 329.00, 397.00, 406.00, 445.00, 481.00, 485.00


a. Calculate the five-numer summary for the data. 

1. Maximum: 485.00

2. Minimum: 1.70

3. Median: the position of the median is .5(n+1), $\frac {29}{2} = 14.5$, $241+ \frac {252-241}{2} = 246.5$

4. 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile: the position of the 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile is .25(n+1) = 7.25, Q<sub>1</sub> = 118 + 0.25(168-118) = 130.5

5. 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile: the position of the 3<sup>st</sup> Quartile is .75(n+1) = 21.75, Q<sub>3</sub> = 316 + 0.75(318-316) = 317.5

IQR ( Quartile Range): 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile - 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile = 317.5 - 130.5 = 187

Lower fence: Q<sub>1</sub> - 1.5IQR = 130.5 -1.5(187) = =150
Upper fence: Q<sub>3</sub> + 1.5IQR = 317.5 +1.5(187) = 598

b. Draw a box plot for the data.

c. Are there any outliers? No, there is no measurement which is beyond or lower fence.

d. If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.
Yes, this information is helpful because mercury accumulates in dolphins' bodies over time. Therefore, it is reasonable that young dolphins have relatively lower mercury concentrations. Additionally, the lower quartile and median are significantly higher than the minimum value.
