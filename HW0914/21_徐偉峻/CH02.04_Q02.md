2. n=11 measurements: 2.3, 1.0, 2.1, 6.5, 2.8, 7.8, 1.7, 2.9, 4.4, 5.1, 2.0
For the data set, find the mean, the standard deviation, and the z-scores corresponding to the minimum and maximum in the data set.

The mean: $$\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i} {n}$$ = (2.3+1.0+2.1+6.5+2.8+7.8+1.7+2.9+4.4+5.1+2.0)/11=38.6/11=3.5
Sample standard deviation: $S = \sqrt{S^2} = \sqrt {\frac{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}} {n-1}}=$
