n=8 measurements: 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 4, 3, 5
For the data set, calculate the mean, the median, and the mode. Locate the measures on a dotplot.

The mean: $$\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i} {n}$$ = (3+2+5+6+4+4+3+5)/8=4
The median: the position of the median is .5(n+1), Sort: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, Position: .5(8+1)=4.5<sup>th</sup>, (4+4)/2=4

The mode is the measurement which occurs most frequently.
| number | frequency |
|:------:|:---------:|
|2|1|
|3|2|
|4|2|
|5|2|
|6|1|

The mode is 3, 4 and 5.
