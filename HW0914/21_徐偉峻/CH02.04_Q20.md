a. Calculate the five-numer summary for the data. 

1. Maximum: 485.00

2. Minimum: 1.70

3. Median: the position of the median is .5(n+1), $\frac {29}{2} = 14.5$ 241+$\frac {252-241}{2}$

4. 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile:

5. 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile:

IQR ( Quartile Range): 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile - 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile =

b. Draw a box plot for the data.

c. Are there any outliers?

d. If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.
