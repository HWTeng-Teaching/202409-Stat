|:----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1.72 | 168.00 | 406.00 | 315.00 |

b. Draw a box plot for the data.

c. Are there any outliers?

d. If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.
