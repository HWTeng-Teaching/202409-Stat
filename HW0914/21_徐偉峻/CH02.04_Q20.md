The mercury concentrations (micrograms/gram) in the livers of 28 male striped dolphins were as follow:

| 1.70 | 183.00 | 221.00 | 286.00 |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1.72 | 168.00 | 406.00 | 315.00 |
| 8.80 | 218.00 | 252.00 | 241.00 |
| 5.90 | 180.00 | 329.00 | 397.00 |
|101.00 | 264.00 | 316.00 | 209.00 |
|85.40 | 481.00 | 445.00 | 314.00 |
|118.00 | 485.00 | 278.00 | 318.00 |

a. Calculate the five-numer summary for the data. 

1. Maximum: 481.00

2. Minimum: 1.72

3. Median: 

4. 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile:

5. 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile:

IQR ( Quartile Range): 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile - 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile =

b. Draw a box plot for the data.

c. Are there any outliers?

d. If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.
