a. Draw a box plot for the monthly utulity costs.

Arrange the data set in ascending order, Sort: 233.97, 243.92, 247.34, 252.44, 255.4, 273.8, 286.35, 286.41, 383.68, 408.48, 446.3, 459.21

The position of Q<sub>1</sub>: .25(n+1) = .25(12+1) = .25(13) = 3.25<sup>th</sup>

The lower quartile Q<sub>1</sub>: 247.34 + .25(252.44-247.34) = 248.615 

The position of Q<sub>3</sub>: .75(n+1) = .75(12+1) = .75(13) = 9.75<sup>th</sup>

The upper quartile Q<sub>3</sub>: 383.68 + .75(408.48-383.68) = 402.280

The range of the "middle 50%" of the measurements is the interquartile range (IQR) = Q<sub>3</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub> = 402.280 - 248.615 = 153.665

The position of median: .5(n+1) = .5(13) = 6.5<sup>th</sup>

The median: .5(273.8 + 286.35) = .5(560.15) = 280.08

Isolate outliers by calculating Lower fence: Q<sub>1</sub> - 1.5 IQR and Upper fence: Q<sub>3</sub> - 1.5 IQR

Lower fence: 248.615 - 1.5(153.665) = 18.12

Upper fence: 402.280 + 1.5(153.665) = 632.78

b. What does the box plot tell you about the distribution of utility costs for this household?
