#### c. Are there any outliers?
1. **Calculate the IQR**:\
IQR=Q3−Q1=317.5-130.5=187
2. **To determine if there are outliers, we can use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:**\
Lower bound: 𝑄1−1.5×IQR\
Upper bound: 𝑄3+1.5×IQR
3. **Outliers Analysis**:\
Lower Bound: -150\
Upper Bound: 598\
\
Since all the data points fall within these bounds, there are no outliers in this dataset according to the IQR method.

#### d. Explanation of the Size Difference in the First Four Observations:####
Given that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while the others were more than 8 years old, it's plausible that the younger dolphins have lower mercury concentrations due to their shorter exposure time. Younger dolphins would have had less time to accumulate mercury in their bodies compared to older dolphins. This age difference could explain why the first four observations have much lower mercury concentrations compared to the others in the dataset.
