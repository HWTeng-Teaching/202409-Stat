### 資料集 2: \( n = 11 \) 測量值: 2.3, 1.0, 2.1, 6.5, 2.8, 7.8, 1.7, 2.9, 4.4, 5.1, 2.0

- **平均數:** 
$\bar{x} = 3.51\$

- **標準差:** 
 $s = 2.16$

- **最小值的Z分數 (1.0):** 
  $Z_{\text{min}} = \frac{1.0 - 3.51}{2.16} \approx -1.16  $

- **最大值的Z分數 (7.8):** 
  $Z_{\text{max}} = \frac{7.8 - 3.51}{2.16} \approx 1.98$

### 離群值分析
  - **資料集 2:** 最小值與最大值的Z分數分別為 -1.16 和 1.98
- Analysis of Outliers
Data Set 2: Similarly, the Z-scores for the minimum and maximum values (-1.16 and 1.98, respectively) are also within the range that would indicate **no significant outliers.** Thus, based on the Z-scores, there do not appear to be any potential outliers in these data sets.

memo:
Z-Score Method:

The Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\
Typical Rule of Thumb:
A Z-score greater than 2 or less than -2 (sometimes 3 or -3) is often considered a potential outlier.\
\
Formula:
$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$
