b. What proportion of the children were 35 months or older, but less than 45 months of age when first enrolled in preschool?

(15+12)/50 = 54%

c. If one child were selected at random from this group of children, what is the probability that the child was less than 50 months old when first enrolled in preschool?

(12+15+12+8)/50 = 94%
