***Data Set 2: ( 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 4, 3, 5 )***

$\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{sum of all the measurements}}{\text{total number}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4$

Reorder: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6

The position of the median 0.5(8+1)=4.5, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th measurements.

$\text{Median} = \frac{4+4}{2} = 4$

-Mode = 3, 4, 5
