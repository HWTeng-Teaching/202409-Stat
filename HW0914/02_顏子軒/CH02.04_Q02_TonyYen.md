***find the mean, the standard deviation, and the z-scores corresponding to the minimum and maximum in the data set. Do the z-scores indicate that there are possible outliers in these data sets?***

***n=11 measurements: 2.3,1.0, 2.1, 6.5, 2.8, 7.8, 1.7, 2.9, 4.4, 5.1, 2.0***

1.mean = 38.6/11=3.51(Rounded to two decimal places)

2.the standard deviation = SQUARE ROOT of 46.85/10 = 2.16(Rounded to two decimal places)

3.z-scores minimum = 1-3.51/2.16 = -1.16(Rounded to two decimal places)

z-scores maximum = 7.8-3.51/2.16 = 1.99(Rounded to two decimal places)

Based on z-scores between +3~-3, there are no outliers in these data sets.
