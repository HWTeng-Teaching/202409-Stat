***a. Draw a box plot for the monthly utility costs.***

Min = 233.97

Max = 459.21

Q1 = 0.25*13 = 3.25th, 247.34+0.25(252.44-247.34) = 248.62(Rounded to two decimal places )

Q3 = 0.75*13 = 9.75th, 383.68+0.75(408.48-383.68) = 402.28

Median = 273.8+0.5(286.35-273.8) = 280.08(Rounded to two decimal places )


***b.What does the box plot tell you about the distribution of utility costs for this household?"""
