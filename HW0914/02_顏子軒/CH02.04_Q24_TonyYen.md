***a. Draw a box plot for the monthly utility costs.***

Min = 233.97

Max = 459.21

Q1 = 0.25*13 = 3.25th, 247.34+0.25(252.44-247.34) = 248.62(Rounded to two decimal places )

Q3 = 0.75*13 = 9.75th, 383.68+0.75(408.48-383.68) = 402.28

Median = 273.8+0.5(286.35-273.8) = 280.08(Rounded to two decimal places )

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 153.67

Lower bound = Q1-1.5IQR = 248.62 - 1.5*153.67 = 18.12

Upper bound = Q3+1.5IQR = 402.28 + 1.5*153.67 = 632.78

***b.What does the box plot tell you about the distribution of utility costs for this household?***

The box plot provides several insights into the distribution of utility costs for this household:

Spread of Data: The utility costs range from about 233.97 (minimum) to 459.21 (maximum), indicating a fairly wide spread in monthly costs.

Median: The median is 280.08, showing that half of the utility costs are below this value and half are above it. Since the median is closer to the lower quartile (Q1), it suggests a slight skew towards higher values.

Interquartile Range (IQR): The interquartile range (IQR), which spans from Q1 (248.62) to Q3 (402.28), represents the middle 50% of the data. This large IQR indicates significant variability in utility costs between these months.

Skewness: The distance between the minimum and the first quartile (Q1) is smaller than the distance between the third quartile (Q3) and the maximum. This suggests a right-skewed distribution, where a few months have higher utility costs, pulling the data to the right.

Outliers: There are no extreme outliers beyond the whiskers of the plot, implying that the range of utility costs is within reasonable bounds for this household.

In summary, the distribution is slightly skewed to the right, indicating higher costs in some months, with no extreme outliers.
