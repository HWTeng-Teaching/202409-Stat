1.Minimun=1.70

2.The lower quartile(Q1) = 0.25(28+1) = 7.25

  -***Q1*** = 118+0.25(168-118) = 130.5

3.The upper quartile(Q3) = 0.75(28+1) = 21.75

  -***Q3***= 316+0.75(318-316) = 317.5

4. Median(Q2)

  -***Median***= 241+0.5(252-241) = 246.5

5. Maximum = 485.00

***Are there any outliers?***

IQR = Q3-Q1 = 317.5-130.5 = 187

Lower bound = Q1-1.5*IQR = -150 

Upper bound = Q3+1.5IQR = 597.5
   
Since there is no data below the lower bound or above the upper bound, this data set has no outliers.


***If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.***

If the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old and the rest were more than  over 8 years old, this could explain why the first four dolphins have lower mercury concentrations due to their shorter growth period, while the other dolphins have significantly higher mercury concentrations because they have been growing for a longer time.
