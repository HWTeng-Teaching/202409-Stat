1.Minimun=1.70

2.The lower quartile(Q1) = 0.25(28+1) = 7.25th

  -***Q1*** = 118+0.25(168-118) = 130.5

3.The upper quartile(Q3) = 0.75(28+1) = 21.75th

  -***Q3***= 316+0.75(318-316) = 317.5

4. Median(Q2)

  -***Median***= 241+0.5(252-241) = 246.5

5. Maximum = 485.00

***Are there any outliers?***

IQR = Q3-Q1 = 317.5-130.5 = 187

Lower bound = Q1-1.5*IQR = -150 

Upper bound = Q3+1.5IQR = 597.5
   
Since there is no data below the lower bound or above the upper bound, this data set has no outliers.


***If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.***

Younger dolphins, having spent less time in the environment, are likely to have had less exposure to mercury. Since mercury accumulates in tissues over time, older dolphins (those over 8 years old) would naturally have higher mercury concentrations as they have been exposed for a longer period.

In contrast, the younger dolphins, being less than 3 years old, would have had significantly less time to accumulate mercury in their bodies, resulting in much lower concentrations. This difference in age and duration of exposure to mercury explains why the first four dolphins have much smaller mercury levels compared to the older dolphins in the data set.
