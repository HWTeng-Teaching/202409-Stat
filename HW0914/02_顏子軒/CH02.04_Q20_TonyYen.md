***a.Calculate the five-number summary for the data.***

1.Minimun=1.70

2.The lower quartile(Q1) = 0.25(28+1) = 7.25

  -***Q1*** = 118+0.25(168-118) = 130.5

3.The upper quartile(Q3) = 0.75(28+1) = 21.75

  -***Q3***= 316+0.75(318-316) = 317.5

4. Median(Q2)

  -***Median***= 241+0.5(252-241) = 246.5

5. Maximum = 485.00

***Draw a box plot for the data.***

***Are there any outliers?***

***If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.***
