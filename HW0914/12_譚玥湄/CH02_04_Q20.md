**a. Calcuate the five-number summary for the data **   
The n=28 measurements are ranked from smllest to largest   
1.7,1.72,5.9,8.8,85.4,101,118,168,180,183,  
209,218,221,241,252,264,278,286,314,315,  
316,318,329,397,406,445,481,485  

The position of the median , Q1 and Q3 are  
- .5(n+1)= 0.5(28+1) = 14.5  
- .25(n+1)= 0.25(28+1) =7.25  
- .75(n+1)= 0.75(28+1) = 21.75  

so that
- min = 1.7
- max = 485
- median = 0.5(241+252)=246.5
- Q1 = 118+ 0.25(168-118)=130.5
- Q3 = 316+ 0.75(318−316)=317.5

**b.Draw a box plot for the data**

**c.Are there any outliners?**   
IQR = 317.5 -130.5 = 187
-Lower Fence = 130.5 - 1.5(187) = -150
-Upper Fence = 130.5 + 1.5(187) = 598
Since all data is between Lower & Upper Fence , there are no outliner

**d.If you knews that the first four dophins where all less than 3 years old ,  
    while all the others where more than 8 years old ,  
    would this information help explain the differene in the size of those four observations ? **  
汞的濃度在前四隻年紀小於3歲的Dophin的檢測量,遠小於其他大於8歲 的Dophin
讓我們有理由推論汞是會隨年紀增加累積在Dophin體內,且無法排除, 這可能會影響Dophin健康,導致夀命減少
