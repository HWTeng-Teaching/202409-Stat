### Testing the Slope of the Line

***Use the data given in
Exercises
5–6 (Exercises 17–18, Section 12.1). Do the
data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that y and
x are linearly related? Test using the t statistic at the
1% level of significance. Construct a 99% confidence
interval
for the slope of the line. What does the phrase
“99% confident” mean?***

>### Interpretation:
>
>**1. Hypothesis Testing:**
>
>- Null Hypothesis $H_0$ : There is no linear relationship between 𝑥 and 𝑦(𝛽 = 0)
>- Alternative Hypothesis $H_a$ : There is a linear relationship between  𝑥 and 𝑦(𝛽 $\neq$ 0)
>
>The calculated 𝑡-statistic (5.20) does not exceed the critical 𝑡-value (5.84), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that 
𝑥 and 𝑦 are linearly related.
>
>**2. 99% Confidence Interval:**
>  
>   The slope of the regression line lies in the interval (−0.15,2.55) with 99% confidence. This means we are 99% confident that the true slope of the population regression line is between −0.15 and 2.55.
>
>**3. Meaning of "99% Confident":**
>
>If we were to repeat the experiment many times and calculate a confidence interval for the slope each time, 99% of those intervals would contain the true slope of the population regression line.
