### Testing the Slope of the Line

***Use the data given in
Exercises
5–6 (Exercises 17–18, Section 12.1). Do the
data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that y and
x are linearly related? Test using the t statistic at the
1% level of significance. Construct a 99% confidence
interval
for the slope of the line. What does the phrase
“99% confident” mean?***

>*1. Least-Squares Regression Line*
>
>- Compute means:
>>$\overline{x}$ = 0
>>
>>$\overline{y}$ = 3
>
>- Compute sums:
>
>>$S_{xx}$ = 10
>>
>>$S_{xy}$ = 12
>>
>>$S_{yy}$ = 16
>
>- Calculate slope and intercept:
>
>>$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ = $\frac{12}{10} = 2$
>>
>>$a = \overline{y} - b \overline{x}$ = 3

>*2. Testing Linear Relationship*
>
>Hypotheses:
>
>- $H_0 : b=0$  (no linear relationship)
>- $H_a : b\neq0$ (there is a linear relationship)
>
> t-Statistic Formula: $t = \frac{b}{SE_b}$ = 
>
>>$SE_b$ = $\sqrt{\frac{S_{yy}-b \times S_{xy}}{{n-2}}}$ $\times \frac{1}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}$ = $\sqrt{\frac{1.6}{3}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}$ = 0.23094
>>
>>$S_{yy} = \sum{y_i - \overline{y}}^2$

>*3. Critical t-Value*
>
>The critical 𝑡-value for a two-tailed test at the 1% significance level is found using:
>
>>$t_{critical} = t_{\alpha/2,n-2}$
>>
>>Where:
>>
>>-$\alpaha = 0.01$((significance level)
>>-$df = n-2$ (degrees of freedom)
>
>*4. 99% Confidence Interval for the Slope*
>
>The confidence interval for the slope is given by: $b \pm t_{critial} \times SE_b
