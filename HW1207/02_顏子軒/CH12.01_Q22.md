### Armspan and Height

***Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) drew a sketch of a man, indicating that a person’s armspan (measuring across the back with your arms outstretched to make a “T”) is roughly equal to the person’s height. To test this claim, we measured eight people with the following results:***

>**a. Draw a scatterplot for armspan and height. Use the same scale on both the horizontal and vertical axes. Describe the relationship between the two variables.**
>
>- The scatterplot above shows the relationship between armspan and height.
>
>- The red dashed line represents the ideal case where armspan equals height $(y=x)$
>- The data points mostly align with the red line, indicating a positive linear relationship.

>**b. If da Vinci is correct, and a person’s armspan is roughly the same as the person’s height, what should the slope of the regression line be?**
>
>If da Vinci is correct and armspan is roughly equal to height, the slope of the regression line should be $b=1$
>
><br/>
>
>**c. Calculate the regression line for predicting height based on a person’s armspan. Does the value of the slope b confirm your conclusions in part b?**
>
>The regression line equation is: $\hat{y} = a + b \times x$
>
>- Mean of $x$ armspan : $\overline{x}$ = 161
>- Mean of $y$ height : $\overline{y}$ = 161.375
>- Cross-product: $S_{xy} = \sum (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})$ = 568
>- Sum of squares: $S_{xx} = \sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2 = 468$
>- Slope of the line: $b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ = $\frac{568}{468} \approx 0.8239$
>- Intercept: $a = \overline{y} - b \times \overline{x}$ = $161.375 - 0.8239 \times 161 \approx 29.6003$

>
>**d. If a person has an armspan of 157 centimeters, what would you predict the person’s height to be?**
>
>Using the regression equation: $y = 29.6003 + 0.8239x$
>
>Substitute $x = 157$: $y=29.6003+0.8239 \times157 = 158.9595cm$

>*This value suggests that the relationship is strong but does not perfectly align with da Vinci's claim.*
