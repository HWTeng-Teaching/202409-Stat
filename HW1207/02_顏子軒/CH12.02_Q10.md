***a. If the researcher thinks that BMI is a function of
income, which of the two variables is the independent
variable x and which is the dependent variable y?***
>
>- Income is the independent variable (𝑥), as it is believed to influence BMI.
>- BMI is the dependent variable (𝑦), as it depends on or is predicted by income.
>
><br/>
***b. Find the least-squares line relating BMI to income.***
>
>- $\overline{x} = 40.42$
>- $\overline{y} = 27$
>- $S_{xx} = \sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2 = 2254.5$
>- $S_{xy} = \sum(x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y}) = -332.43$
>- $b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xy}} = \frac{-332.43}{2254.5} = -0.1476$
>- $a = \overline{y} - b \times \overline{x} = 27 - (-0.1476)(40.42) = 32.91$
>
>**Final regression line: $\hat{y} = 32.91 - 0.15 x$**

***c. Construct the ANOVA table for the linear regression.***
