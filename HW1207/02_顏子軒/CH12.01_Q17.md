### Method of Least Squares

***Use the data given in Exercises 17â€“18. Calculate the sums of squares and cross-products, Sxx and Sxy. Find the least-squares line for the data. Plot the points and graph the line on the same graph. Does the line appear to provide a good fit to the data points?***

>**1.Sums of Squares and Cross-Products:**
>
>$S_{xx}$ = $\sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2$ = 10
>
>$S_{xy}$ = $\sum(x_i - \overline{x}) (y_i - \overline{y})$ = 12

>**2.Least-Squares Line:**
>
>The least-squares line is given by:
>
>$y = a + bx$
>
>$b = \frac{S_{xx}}{S_{xy}} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2$
>
>$a = \overline{y} - b \times \overline{x} = 3 - 1.2 \times 0 = 3$
>
>Final equation of the least-squares line: $\hat{y} = 3 + 1.2x$
