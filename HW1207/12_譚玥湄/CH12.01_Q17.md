Method of Least Squares Use the data given in Exercises 17–18. Calculate the sums of squares and cross-products, $S_{xx}$$ and $S_{xy}$. Find the least-squares line for the data. Plot the points and graph the line on the same graph. Does the line appear to provide a good fit to the data points?

Here is the plot showing the data points and the least-squares line 
𝑦 = 3 + 1.2𝑥
y=3+1.2x. The line appears to provide a good fit to the data points, as it captures the general trend of the data well.
