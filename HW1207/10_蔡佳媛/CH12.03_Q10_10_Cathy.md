## a. Find the least-squares line relating the percentage arrested to the group median age.  

$\hat{y} = a + bx = 93.617 - 1.251x$

## b. Do the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that $x$ and $y$ are linearly related? Test using the $t$ statistic at the 5% level of significance.  

**t statistic**

$H_{0}: \beta = 0$ (Slope of the line is 0)  
$H_{1}: \beta \neq 0$ (Slope of the line is not 0)  

two-tail test, $\alpha$=0.05  

Reject region: The $t_{STAT}$, 20.436, is greater than 2.571, which falls into the rejection region. Therefore, $H_{0}$ is rejected. 

p-value: The p-value is 0, which is less than 0.025, $H_{0}$ is rejected

The results indicate that the slope of the regression line is unlikely to be 0, suggesting a significant linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.  



## c. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the line.  

This is a two-tail test, and the lower bound for 95% confidence interval is -1.559.

The lower bound = $b - t_{\alpha / 2} \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}}$ = -1.559  

$-1.251 - t_{\alpha / 2} \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}}$ = -1.559  

$t_{\alpha / 2} \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}}$ = -1.251 +1.559 = 0.308  

The upper bound = -1.251 + 0.308 = -0.943  

The resulting 95% confidence interval is -1.559 to -0.943.  



## d. Find the coefficient of determination and interpret its significance.  

Coefficient of determination = $\frac{SSR}{Total SS} = R^2 = 0.9564$

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4720a504-38be-43aa-a207-c6ca8022cd80)

The $R^2$ value indicates that 95.64% of the total variation in $y$ is explained by the linear regression model of $y$ on $x$.
