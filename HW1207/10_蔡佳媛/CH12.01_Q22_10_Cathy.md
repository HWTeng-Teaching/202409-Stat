### a. Draw a scatterplot for armspan and height. Use the same scale on both the horizontal and vertical axes. Describe the relationship between the two variables.

### b. If da Vinci is correct, and a person's armspan is roughly the same as the person's height, what should the slope of the regression line be?  
  
The slope of the regression line should be 1, indicating that the regression line has the form $\hat{y}=x$.
  
  
  
### c. Calculate the regression line for predicting height based on a person's armspan. Does the value of the slope $b$ confirm your conclusions in part b?  
  
| Person        |    1   |    2   |    3   |    4   |    5   |    6   |    7   |    8   |  Total  | Average |  
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|  
| Armspan ($x$) |    172 |    158 |    165 |    176 |    172 |    175 |    157 |   153  |   1,328 | 166     |  
| Height  ($y$) |    175 |    157 |    165 |    177 |    170 |    170 |    160 |   157  |   1,331 | 166.375 |  
|      $x^2$    | 29,584 | 24,964 | 27,225 | 30,976 | 29,584 | 30,625 | 24,649 | 23,409 | 221,016 |  
|      $xy$     | 30,100 | 24,806 | 27,225 | 31,152 | 29,240 | 29,750 | 25,120 | 24,021 | 221,414 |  
  
$S_{xx} = \sum{{x_{i}}^2} - n\bar{x}^2$  
$S_{xx} = 221,016 - 8 \times 166^2 = 568$  
  
$S_{xy} = \sum{x_{i}y_{i}} - n\bar{x}\bar{y}$  
$S_{xy} = 221,414 - 8 \times 166 \times 166.375 = 468$  
  
$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{468}{568} = 0.8239$  
$a = \bar{y} - b \times \bar{x} = 166.375 - 0.8239 \times 166 = 29.6076$  
  
Regression line: $\hat{y} = a + bx = 29.6076 + 0.8239x$  
  
The value of the slope differs from the conclusion in part b because the sample data deviates from da Vinci's idealized relationship.  
  
  
  
### d. If a person has an armspan of 157 centimeters, what would you predict the person's height to be?
  
According to regression line: $\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239x$, the predicted height of the person would be 158.9599 centimeters.
