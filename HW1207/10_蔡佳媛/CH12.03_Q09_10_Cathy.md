### a. Draw a scatterplot of the number of miles of roadways in the U.S. over time. Describe the pattern that you see?

The pattern shows a positive linear trend with a steady rate of increasing miles of roadways over time. 


### b. Find the least-aquares line describing these data. Do the data indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year? Test using a $t$ statistic with $\alpha$=0.05.




### c. Construct the ANOVA table and use the $F$ statistic to answer the question in part b. Verify that the square of the $t$ statistic in part b is equal to $F$.




### d. Calculate $r^2$. What does this value tell you about the effectiveness of the linear regression analysis?
