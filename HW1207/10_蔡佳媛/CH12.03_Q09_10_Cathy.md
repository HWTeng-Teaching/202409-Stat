### a. Draw a scatterplot of the number of miles of roadways in the U.S. over time. Describe the pattern that you see?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12df0fd4-c880-4d5a-b3fc-30245be22697)

The pattern shows a positive linear trend with a steady rate of increasing miles of roadways over time. 


### b. Find the least-aquares line describing these data. Do the data indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year? Test using a $t$ statistic with $\alpha$=0.05.

**Least-squares line**  

$S_{xx} = \sum{{x_{i}}^2} - n\bar{x}^2$  
$S_{xx} = 1,240 - 16 \times 7.5^2 = 340$  
  
$S_{xy} = \sum{x_{i}y_{i}} - n\bar{x}\bar{y}$  
$S_{xy} = 132.8 - 16 \times 7.5 \times 1.0413 = 7.044$  
  
$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{7.044}{340} = 0.02071764706 \approx 0.0207$  
$a = \bar{y} - b \times \bar{x} = 1.0413 - 0.0207 \times 7.5 = 0.88605$  

Least-squares line: $\hat{y} = a + bx = 0.88605 + 0.0207x$  


**t statistic**  





### c. Construct the ANOVA table and use the $F$ statistic to answer the question in part b. Verify that the square of the $t$ statistic in part b is equal to $F$.

Total SS = $S_{yy} = \sum{{y_{i}}^2} - n {\bar{y}}^2 = 17.5336 - 16 \times 1.0413^2 \approx 0.1847$  

SSR = $\frac{{S_{xy}}^2}{S_{xx}}$ = $\frac{7.044^2}{340} \approx 0.1459$  

SSE = Total SS - SSR = $0.1847 - 0.1459 = 0.0388$  


**ANOVA table**  

|   Source   |       df     |     SS    |     MS     |  
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|  
| Regression |       1      | **0.1459**| **0.1459** |  
| Error      | n-2 = **14** | **0.0388**| **0.00277**|  
| Total      | n-1 = **15** | **0.1847**|  


**F statistic**  

1. $H_{0}$: The model is not useful in predicting $y$  
   $H_{1}$: The model is useful in predicting $y$

2. Set up $\alpha$ = 0.05

3. Test statistic: F = $\frac{MSR}{MSE} \sim F_{1,(n-2)}$

4. Calculate realized statistic F*
   $\frac{0.1459}{0.00277} \sim F_{1, 14}$ = 52.67148

5. Find the rejection region

6. Conclude
   Reject $H_{0}$ if $F \lt F_{\alpha}$ with 1 and n-2 df  
   Reject $H_{0}$ because F* = 52.67148, which is greater than $F_{\alpha}$ with 1 and 14 df  


### d. Calculate $r^2$. What does this value tell you about the effectiveness of the linear regression analysis?
