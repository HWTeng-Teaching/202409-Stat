## a. Draw a scatterplot of the number of miles of roadways in the U.S. over time. Describe the pattern that you see?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a144f902-351c-42a5-b8df-46844c790e35)  

The pattern shows a positive linear trend with a steady rate of increasing miles of roadways over time. 
  
  
  
## b. Find the least-aquares line describing these data. Do the data indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year? Test using a $t$ statistic with $\alpha$=0.05.

### Least-squares line  

$S_{xx} = \sum{{x_{i}}^2} - n\bar{x}^2$  
$S_{xx} = 1,240 - 16 \times 7.5^2 = 340$  
  
$S_{xy} = \sum{x_{i}y_{i}} - n\bar{x}\bar{y}$  
$S_{xy} = 132.8 - 16 \times 7.5 \times 1.04125 = 7.85$  
  
$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{7.85}{340} = 0.02308823529 \approx 0.0231$  
$a = \bar{y} - b \times \bar{x} = 1.04125 - 0.0231 \times 7.5 = 0.868$  

Least-squares line: $\hat{y} = a + bx = 0.868 + 0.0231x$  


### t statistic  

Total SS = $S_{yy} = \sum{{y_{i}}^2} - n {\bar{y}}^2 = 17.5336 - 16 \times 1.04125^2 = 0.186375 \approx 0.1864$  

SSR = $\frac{{S_{xy}}^2}{S_{xx}}$ = $\frac{7.85^2}{340} = 0.18124264705 \approx 0.1812$  

SSE = Total SS - SSR = $0.1864 - 0.1812 = 0.0052$  

MSE = $\frac{0.0052}{14} = 0.00037142857 \approx 0.00037$  
  
1. $H_{0}: \beta = 0$ (Slope of the line is 0) vs $H_{1}: \beta \neq 0$ (Slope of the line is not 0)  

2. Set $\alpha$=0.05  

3. $t_{STAT} = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}}} \sim t_{(n-2)}$  

4. Calculate t* = $\frac{0.0231-0}{\sqrt{\frac{0.00037}{340}}} = 22.14371975 \approx 22.1437$  

5. Find the rejection region or p-value: Reject $H_{0}$ if $t* \lt -2.145$ or $t* \gt 2.145$

6. Conclude: The $t*$ is greater than 2.145, which falls into the rejection region. Therefore, $H_{0}$ is rejected.
   This indicates that the slope of the regression line is unlikely to be 0, suggesting a significant linear relationship between the number of miles of roadway and the year. 
  
  
  
## c. Construct the ANOVA table and use the $F$ statistic to answer the question in part b. Verify that the square of the $t$ statistic in part b is equal to $F$.
  
  
### ANOVA table  

|   Source   |       df     |     SS    |     MS     |      F      |  
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|  
| Regression |       1      | **0.1812**| **0.1812** | **489.7297**|  
| Error      | n-2 = **14** | **0.0052**| **0.00037**|  
| Total      | n-1 = **15** | **0.1864**|  


### F statistic  

1. $H_{0}$: The model is not useful in predicting $y$  
   $H_{1}$: The model is useful in predicting $y$

2. Set up $\alpha$ = 0.05

3. Test statistic: F = $\frac{MSR}{MSE} \sim F_{1,(n-2)}$

4. Calculate realized statistic F*
   $\frac{0.1812}{0.00037} \sim F_{1, 14} = 489.729729729 \approx 489.7297$  

5. Find the rejection region

6. Conclude
   Reject $H_{0}$ if $F \lt F_{\alpha}$ with 1 and n-2 df  
   Reject $H_{0}$ because F* = 489.7297, which is greater than $F_{\alpha}$ with 1 and 14 df
   This indicates that the slope of the regression line is unlikely to be 0, suggesting a significant linear relationship between the number of miles of roadway and the year. 

### Verify the $t^2$ is equal to $F$

The square of t statistic in part b is $22.1437^2$ $\approx$ 490.3434, which is close to F statistic 489.7297


## d. Calculate $r^2$. What does this value tell you about the effectiveness of the linear regression analysis?

$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SS_{Total}}$  

$R^2 = \frac{0.1812}{0.1864} \approx 0.972103 = 97.21%$  

The $R^2$ value indicates that 97.21% of the total variation in $y$ is explained by the linear regression model of $y$ on $x$.
