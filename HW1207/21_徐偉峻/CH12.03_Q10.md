The data that follow reports the group median age at which a prisoner was released from a federal prison and the percentage of those arrested for another crime. Use the MS Excel printout to answer the questions that follow.

a. Find the least-squares line relating the percentage arrested to the group median age.

b. Do the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that x and y are linearly related? Test using the t statistic at the 5% level of significance.

c. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the line.

d. Find the coefficient of determination and interpret its significance.
