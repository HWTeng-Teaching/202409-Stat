Armspan and Height
Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) drew a sketch of a man, indicating that a person's armspan (measuring across the back with your arms outstretched to make a "T") is roughly equal to the person's height. To test this claim, we measured eight people with the following results:

| Person  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Armspan | 172 | 158 | 165 | 176 |
| Height  | 175 | 157 | 165 | 177 |
