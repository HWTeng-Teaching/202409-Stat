Armspan and Height
Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) drew a sketch of a man, indicating that a person's armspan (measuring across the back with your arms outstretched to make a "T") is roughly equal to the person's height. To test this claim, we measured eight people with the following results in centimeters:

| Person  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  
|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Armspan | 172 | 158 | 165 | 176 | 172 | 175 | 157 | 153 |
| Height  | 175 | 157 | 165 | 177 | 170 | 170 | 160 | 157 |

a. Draw a scatterplot for armspan and height. Use the same scale on both the horizontal and vertical axes.
Describe the relationship between the two variables.

b. If da Vinci is correct, and a person's armspan is roughly the same as the person's height, what should the slope of the regression line be?

c. Calculate the regression line for predicting height based on a person's armspan. Does the value of the slope b confirm your conclusions in part b?

d. If a person has an armspan of 157 centimeters, what would you predict the person's height to be?


$\bar{x}$ = $\frac{172 + 158 + 165 + 176 + 172 + 175 + 157+ 153}{8}$ = 166

$\bar{y}$ = $\frac{175 + 157 + 165 + 177 + 170 + 170 + 160 + 157}{8}$ = 166.375

$S_{xx}$ = $\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$ = 568

$S_{xy}$ = $\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}$ = 468

The least-squares line: y = a + bx 

b = $S_{xy}$ / $S_{xx}$ = 0.8239

a = $\bar{y}$ - b $\cdot$ $\bar{x}$ = 29.6003

y = 29.6003 + 0.8239x
