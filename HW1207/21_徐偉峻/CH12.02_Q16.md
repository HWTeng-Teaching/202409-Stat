Strawberries: The following data were obtained in an experiment relating the dependent variable, y (texture of strawberries), with x (coded storage temperature).

| x | -2  | -2  |  0  |  2  |  2  |
|:-:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| y | 4.0 | 3.5 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 |

a. Find the least-squares line for the data.

$S_{xx}$ = 16 
$S_{xy}$ = -14
$S_{yy}$ = 12.5

b = -0.875
a = 2

y = a + bx = 2 - 0.875x

b. Plot the data points and graph the least-squares line as a check on your calculations.

intercept of y a = 2.00

slope b = âˆ’0.88

it means when the temperature increases and the texture of strawberries decrease.

c. Construct the ANOVA table.

|       | DF    | SS | MS |
| ----  | --    | -- | -- |
| Reg   | 1     | 12.25  | 12.25  |
| Error | 3     | 0.25 |0.0833  |
| Tatol | 4     | 12.5 |

$df_{reg}$ = 1

$df_{error}$ = n-k = 3

$df_{total}$ = n-1 = 4
   
SST = $\sum{(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$ =  $\sum{y_i^2}-(\sum{y_i})^2/n$ = 12.5

SSR = $\sum{(\hat{y_i}-\bar{y})^2}$ = $\sum{\hat{y_i}^2}-(\sum{y_i})^2/n$ =  $S_{xy}^2$ / $S_{xx}$ = 12.25

SSE = SST - SSR = 12.5-12.25 = 0.25

MSR = SSR / $df_{reg}$ = 12.25 /1 = 12.25

MSE = SSE / $df_{error}$ = 0.25 / 3 = 0.0833
