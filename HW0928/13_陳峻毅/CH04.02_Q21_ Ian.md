Total number of ways to choose 2 candies from 5:

The total number of ways to select 2 candies from 5 is calculated using combinations:
$\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$\
Favorable outcomes:\
You get the orange candy. This means your first candy is fixed (orange).
Your friend must not get the red candy. So, the second candy must be from the remaining candies, excluding the red one. The remaining candies are brown, yellow, and blue (3 candies).
Thus, the favorable choices for your friend are 3 (brown, yellow, blue).\
Probability:
The number of favorable outcomes (orange for you, and brown/yellow/blue for your friend) is 3.\
Therefore, $\text{Probability} = \frac{3}{10}$
