**a**.\
**Independent Variable**: The variable that is controlled or manipulated is the **temperature**. The temperature is varied, and the chirp rate of the crickets is observed based on that.\
**Dependent Variable**: The variable that is measured or observed is the number of **chirps per second**. The chirp rate changes in response to the temperature.

**c.**\
assume Chirps per second=y and Temperature=x \
$y = 0.405 \cdot x + 6.115$
\
\
**d.**\
$y=0.405\cdot 27+6.115â‰ˆ17.06 \ chirps \ per\ second$
