**a.**\
**Independent Variable**: The variable that is controlled or provides the basis for the prediction is **height**. The height of the building influences how many floors it can accommodate.\
**Dependent Variable**: The variable that is measured or predicted based on the independent variable is **the number of floors**. The number of floors depends on the height of the building.\
\
**b.**
\
x= height(meter)\
y= the number of floors\
\
$\{r = \frac{n \sum{xy} - \left(\sum{x}\right) \left(\sum{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\left[n \sum{x^2} - \left(\sum{x}\right)^2\right] \left[n \sum{y^2} - \left(\sum{y}\right)^2\right]}}\}$ \=0.956\
*Solution*:  This value is close to 1, indicating a very strong positive linear relationship between the height of a building and the number of floors. This means that as the height of a building increases, the number of floors tends to increase as well.

The least-squares regression line equation is:\
$y = 0.208x + 7.07$
Use Residual Analysi to identify whether there are outliers or not
1.  Calculate the Residuals\
2. $\text{Residual} = y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{predicted}}\$

Where:
$\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_{\text{observed}}$ is the actual number of floors from the dataset,
    \item $y_{\text{predicted}}$ is the number of floors predicted by the regression model.
\end{itemize}$

For example, for a building with a height of 335 meters and 73 floors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The predicted number of floors (using the regression equation) is around 76.65.
    \item The residual is: 
    \[
    73_{\text{observed}} - 76.65_{\text{predicted}} = -3.65
    \]
\end{itemize}

This residual is negative, indicating the actual number of floors is less than what the model predicted.

\subsection{3. Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Residuals}
The standard deviation of the residuals helps us quantify how much the residuals vary. If a residual is significantly larger than this variation, it can be flagged as a potential outlier.

We calculate the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the residuals using:

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (\text{Residuals})^2}
\]

Where $n$ is the number of data points.

\subsection{4. Identify Outliers Using Residuals}
To detect outliers, we check whether any residual is more than 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean. A commonly used threshold is 2 standard deviations:

\[
\text{Outlier Criterion}: |\text{Residual}| > 2 \times \sigma
\]

In our analysis, we calculated the residuals and found the standard deviation of the residuals. Based on this, we identified one data point where the residual is significantly larger than 2 standard deviations, marking it as a potential outlier.

\subsection{Detailed Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The residuals were calculated for each building. Some sample residuals:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Building with a height of 335 meters and 73 floors had a residual of $-3.65$,
            \item Building with a height of 197 meters and 58 floors had a residual of $10.05$, which is much larger than the others.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The standard deviation of the residuals was computed to identify extreme values.
    \item We found that the building with 197 meters and 58 floors has a residual larger than 2 standard deviations, making it a potential outlier.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
By performing residual analysis, we flagged the building with 197 meters and 58 floors as an outlier. This building has a much higher number of floors than the regression model predicts, suggesting it might have unique characteristics that differentiate it from other buildings in the dataset.
