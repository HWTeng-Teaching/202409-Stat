## a.
**Independent Variable**: The variable that is controlled or provides the basis for the prediction is **height**. The height of the building influences how many floors it can accommodate.\
**Dependent Variable**: The variable that is measured or predicted based on the independent variable is **the number of floors**. The number of floors depends on the height of the building.\
## b.
\
x= height(meter)\
y= the number of floors\
\
$\{r = \frac{n \sum{xy} - \left(\sum{x}\right) \left(\sum{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\left[n \sum{x^2} - \left(\sum{x}\right)^2\right] \left[n \sum{y^2} - \left(\sum{y}\right)^2\right]}}\}$ \=0.956\
*Solution*:  This value is close to 1, indicating a very strong positive linear relationship between the height of a building and the number of floors. This means that as the height of a building increases, the number of floors tends to increase as well.

The least-squares regression line equation is:\
$y = 0.208x + 7.07$
Use Residual Analysis to identify whether there are outliers or not
1.  Calculate the Residuals
2. $\text{Residual} = y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{predicted}}\$ \
For example, for a building with a height of 335 meters and 73 floors:\
$y_{\text{observed}}=73$ \
$y_{\text{predicted}}=76.75$

The residual is: 
$73_{\text{observed}} - 76.75_{\text{predicted}} = -3.75\$

This residual is negative, indicating the actual number of floors is less than what the model predicted.
\
3. Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Residuals
The standard deviation of the residuals helps us quantify how much the residuals vary. If a residual is significantly larger than this variation, it can be flagged as a potential outlier.\
We calculate the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the residuals using:\
$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (\text{Residuals})^2} = 2.78$
\
Where $n$ is the number of data points.

4. Identify Outliers Using Residuals
To detect outliers, we check whether any residual is more than 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean. A commonly used threshold is 2 standard deviations:

$\text{Outlier Criterion}: |\text{Residual}| > 2 \times \sigma$\
$2 \sigma = 5.56$\
In our analysis, we calculated the residuals and found the standard deviation of the residuals. Based on this, we identified one data point where the residual is significantly larger than 2 standard deviations(5.56), marking it as a potential outlier.

-----------------------------
**Solution**:\
We found that the Building 14 with 197 meters and 58 floors has a residual larger than 2 standard deviations, making it a potential outlier.By performing residual analysis, we flagged the building with 197 meters and 58 floors as an outlier. This building has a much higher number of floors than the regression model predicts, suggesting it might have unique characteristics that differentiate it from other buildings in the dataset.
## d.
$y = 0.208x + 7.07$\
y=48,then x=196.778\
This means that a building in Los Angeles with 48 floors is expected to be about 197.78 meters tall.
