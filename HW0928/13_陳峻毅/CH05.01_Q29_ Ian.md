Let's work through the problem you provided regarding drilling oil wells, which is based on a geometric probability distribution.

The problem states that:
- The probability of hitting oil on any given drilling is $\frac{1}{10} $, or 0.1.
- Let \( x \) represent the number of drillings until the first success (i.e., hitting oil).

This type of problem follows a **geometric distribution** where the probability mass function (PMF) for a geometric distribution is:

$p(x) = (1 - p)^{x-1} p$

where:
- \( p \) is the probability of success (in this case, hitting oil, which is 0.1,
- \( x \) is the number of trials (drillings) until the first success.

### Part (a): Find  p(1),p(2),and p(3)

Using the formula p(x) = $(1 - p)^{x-1} p$ and substituting  p = 0.1 :

1. **p(1) is the probability of hitting oil on the first try:**
   $p(1) = (1 - 0.1)^{1-1} \times 0.1 = 1 \times 0.1 = 0.1$

2. **p(2) is the probability of hitting oil on the second try:**
   $p(2) = (1 - 0.1)^{2-1} \times 0.1 = (0.9) \times 0.1 = 0.09$

3. **p(3) is the probability of hitting oil on the third try:**
   $p(3) = (1 - 0.1)^{3-1} \times 0.1 = (0.9)^2 \times 0.1 = 0.81 \times 0.1 = 0.081$

So, the probabilities are:
$p(1) = 0.1, \quad p(2) = 0.09, \quad p(3) = 0.081$

### Part (b): Give a formula for p(x):

The general formula for p(x) in this geometric distribution is:
$p(x) = (0.9)^{x-1} \times 0.1$

This formula calculates the probability of hitting oil on the  x-th drilling attempt.

### Part (c): Graph p(x)
