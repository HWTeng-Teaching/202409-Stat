$\textbf{Solution:}$\
We are tasked with finding the probability that exactly two boys and one girl are selected when three children are chosen, with the assumption that the probability of selecting a boy or a girl is equally likely \
$P(\text{boy}) = P(\text{girl}) = \frac{1}{2}$ 

$\textbf{Step 1: Possible Outcomes}$

Each child can either be a boy or a girl, so the possible outcomes for the gender combinations of three children are:

$\text{Sample space} = {\text{BBB}, \text{BBG}, \text{BGB}, \text{GBB}, \text{GGB}, \text{GBG}, \text{BGG}, \text{GGG}}$



Thus, there are \( $2^3 = 8 \$) possible outcomes.

$\textbf{Step 2: Favorable Outcomes}$

The favorable outcomes, where there are exactly two boys and one girl, are:

$\text{Favorable Outcomes} = \{ \text{BBG}, \text{BGB}, \text{GBB} \}$

There are 3 favorable outcomes.

$\textbf{Step 3: Probability Calculation}$

Since all outcomes are equally likely, the probability is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

$P(\text{two boys, one girl}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{8}$
