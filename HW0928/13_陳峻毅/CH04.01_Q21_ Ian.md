Using a tree diagram, the first branch will show the 5 options for the first draw, and from each of those options, you will draw the second candy (4 possible outcomes for each first candy).

Here are the pairs of outcomes:

    (R, B), (R, Y), (R, Bl), (R, O)
    (B, R), (B, Y), (B, Bl), (B, O)
    (Y, R), (Y, B), (Y, Bl), (Y, O)
    (Bl, R), (Bl, B), (Bl, Y), (Bl, O)
    (O, R), (O, B), (O, Y), (O, Bl)

These represent all possible combinations of two candies drawn from the bowl. There are a total of 5 x 4 = 20 possible outcomes.
If we draw the tree diagram, it will be like this.
