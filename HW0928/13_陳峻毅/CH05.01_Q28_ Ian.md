**Part (a): List the simple events in SS and assign probabilities to the simple events.**

There are 4 keys in total, and each different sequence of trying the keys until you find the correct one is a simple event.

    Simple events:
        (1): You choose the correct key on the first try.
        (2,1): You choose an incorrect key first, then choose the correct key second.
        (3,2,1): You choose two incorrect keys first, then the correct one.
        (4,3,2,1): You choose three incorrect keys first, then the correct one.
The probabilities for each simple event are:\
$P(1) = \frac{1}{4}, \quad P(2, 1) = \frac{1}{4}, \quad P(3, 2, 1) = \frac{1}{4}, \quad P(4, 3, 2, 1) = \frac{1}{4}
\$\
\
**Part (b): Assign the values of xx to each simple event:**\
Let xx be the number of keys tried before finding the correct one. The values of xx are:
$x = 1 \quad \text{for } (1), \quad x = 2 \quad \text{for } (2, 1), \quad x = 3 \quad \text{for } (3, 2, 1), \quad x = 4 \quad \text{for } (4, 3, 2, 1)$

**Part (c): Probabilities p(x)**

The probabilities for each \( x \) are:

$$
p(x) =
\begin{cases}
0.25 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
0.25 & \text{if } x = 2 \\
0.25 & \text{if } x = 3 \\
0.25 & \text{if } x = 4 \\
\end{cases}
$$

**Part (d): Probability Histogram**
