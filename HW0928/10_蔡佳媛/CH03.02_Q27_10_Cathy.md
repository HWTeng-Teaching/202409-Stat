### a. Which of the two variables (height and floors) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent varible?

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

### b. Find the correlation coefficient, r. What does this tell you about the strength and direction of the relaionship between height and number of floors?

<br/>

$s_x^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}-\frac{(\sum{x})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{70,250-\frac{(1,378)^2}{28}}{27} = \frac{70,250 - 67,817.2857}{27} = 90.1005$

$s_x = 9.4921$

<br/>

<br/>

### c. Plot the data using a scatterplot and describe the patern that you see. Are there any outliers?

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

### d. Find the least-squares line, and use it to predict the height of a building in Los Angeles that has 48 floors.
