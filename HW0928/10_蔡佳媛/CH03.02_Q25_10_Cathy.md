### a. Which of the two variables is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?

<br/>

As male crickets chirp faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperature, the temperature is the independent variable, and the chirps per second is the dependent variable.

<br/>

### b. Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relationship between temperature and number of chirps?

<br/>

The scatterplot shows that temperature and the number of chirps per second are positively correlated. As the temperature increases, the number of chirps per second also increases.

<br/>

### c. Find the least-aquares line relating the number of chirps to the temperature.

$s_x^2 = \frac{(\sum{x^2})-\frac{(\sum{x})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{7,230-\frac{266^2}{10}}{10-1} \approx 17.1556$

$s_x = \sqrt{17.1556} \approx 4.1419$

$s_y^2 = \frac{(\sum{y^2})-\frac{(\sum{y})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{2,887-\frac{169^2}{10}}{10-1} \approx 3.4333$

$s_y = \sqrt{3.4333} \approx 1.8529$

$s_{xy} = \frac{(\sum{xy})-\frac{\sum{x}\times\sum{y}}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{4,558-\frac{266\times169}{10}}{10-1} \approx 6.9556$

$r = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x \times s_y} = \frac{6.9556}{4.1419\times1.8529} = \frac{6.9556}{7.6745} \approx 0.9063$

Assume the least-squares line is $y = a + b \times x$
