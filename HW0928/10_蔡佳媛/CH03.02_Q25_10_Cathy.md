### a. Which of the two variables is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?

<br/>

As male crickets chirp faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperature, the temperature is the independent variable, and the chirps per second is the dependent variable.

<br/>

### b. Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relationship between temperature and number of chirps?
