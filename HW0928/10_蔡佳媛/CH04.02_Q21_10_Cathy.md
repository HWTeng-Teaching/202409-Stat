The probability that I get the orange candy is $\frac{1}{5}$ when drawing one candy out of a bowl that contains five candies of diffrent colors.

<br/>

The probability that my friend does not get the red candy is $\frac{3}{4}$ when drawing one candy out of 
the remaining four candies.

<br/>

Therefore, the probability that I get the orange candy and my friend does not get the red one is $\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{20} = 0.15$
