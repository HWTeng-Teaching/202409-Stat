Because the males and females are equally likely, there are 8 simple events in the sample space:

E1 = (B, B, B)  
E2 = (B, B, G) $\checkmark$    
E3 = (B, G, B) $\checkmark$    
E4 = (B, G, G)  
E5 = (G, B, B) $\checkmark$    
E6 = (G, B, G)  
E7 = (G, G, B)  
E8 = (G, G, G)  

The probability of each simple event is $\frac{1}{8}$

For the simple events that include 2 boys and 1 girl, the probability is 0.375:

$P(E2) \cup P(E3) \cup P(E5) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375$
