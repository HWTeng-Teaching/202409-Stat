***A key ring contains four office
keys that are identical in appearance, but only one
will open your office door. Suppose you randomly
select one key and try it. If it does not fit, you randomly
select one of the three remaining keys. If that
key does not fit, you randomly select one of the last
two. Each different sequence that could occur in
selecting the keys represents a set of equally likely
simple events.***

***a. List the simple events in S and assign probabilities
to the simple events.***

>There are $4! = 24$ different ways you can select the keys in sequence. These sequences are the simple events in the sample space 𝑆

>Let the keys be labeled $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$, $K_4$ where only one of them (say $K_1$ )will open the door. The possible sequences of key selections are the permutations of these keys. Here are a few examples:
>
>1. $(K_1)$— you choose the correct key on the first try.
>2. $(K_2, K_1)$— you choose $K_2$ first, then $K_1$
>3. $(K_3, K_4, K_1)$— you choose $K_3$ first, then $K_4$, and finally $K_1$
>
>In total, there are 24 such sequences

>*Probability Assignment: Since all these simple events are equally likely, the probability of each event (sequence) is:*

***Let x equal the number of keys that you try before you find the one that opens the door (x = 1, 2, 3, 4). Then assign the appropriate value of x to each simple event.***
