***A key ring contains four office
keys that are identical in appearance, but only one
will open your office door. Suppose you randomly
select one key and try it. If it does not fit, you randomly
select one of the three remaining keys. If that
key does not fit, you randomly select one of the last
two. Each different sequence that could occur in
selecting the keys represents a set of equally likely
simple events.***

***a. List the simple events in S and assign probabilities
to the simple events.***
>
>S: success; F: fail
>|          Simple events                   | Event     |       Probability     |
>|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
>| choose the correct key on the First try  | (S)       |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>| choose the correct key on the Sec. try   | (F,S)     |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>| choose the correct key on the Third try  | (F,F,S)   |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>| choose the correct key on the Fourth try | (F,F,F,S) |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |

***b. Let x equal the number of keys that you try before you find the one that opens the door (x = 1, 2, 3, 4). Then assign the appropriate value of x to each simple event.***

>|         | $x$ |   Event  |
>|---------|-----|----------|
>| $p$($x$)|  1  | (S)      |
>| $p$($x$)|  2  | (F,S)    |
>| $p$($x$)|  3  | (F,F,S)  |
>| $p$($x$)|  4  | (F,F,F,S)|

***c. Calculate the values of p(x) and display them in a table.***

>|         | $x$ |      Probability      |
>|---------|-----|-----------------------|
>| $p$($x$)|  1  |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>| $p$($x$)|  2  |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>| $p$($x$)|  3  |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>| $p$($x$)|  4  |     $\frac{1}{4}$     |
>

***d. Construct a probability histogram for p(X)***
