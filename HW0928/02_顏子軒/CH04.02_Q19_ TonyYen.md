***Three children are selected, and
their gender recorded. Assume that males and females
are equally likely. What is the probability that there are
two boys and one girl in the group?***

The probability of having two boys and one girl is:

$𝑃(2 boys, 1 girl) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}}$


*Step 1: Determine the total possible outcomes*

Each child can either be a boy (B) or a girl (G), and there are 3 children. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:

$2^3 = 8$

The possible outcomes are:

BBB
, BBG
, BGB
, BGG
, GBB
, GBG
, GGB
, GGG

*Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes
We want exactly two boys and one girl. The favorable outcomes are:*

BBG, BGB, GBB

There are 3 favorable outcomes.

*Step 3: Calculate the probability
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes:*

$𝑃(2 boys, 1 girl) = \frac{3}{8}$ 
​
 
__Thus, the probability is $\frac{3}{8}$ , or 0.375 (37.5%).__
