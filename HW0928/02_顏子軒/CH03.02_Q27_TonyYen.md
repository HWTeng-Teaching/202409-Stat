***How closely is the height (in meters) of a tall building and the number of floors related? The heights of 28 buildings in downtown Los Angeles and the number of floors for each building follows***

|Height Floors| Height Floors| Height Floors| Height Floors|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|335 73| 220 54| 194 49 |163 41|
|310 73| 219 52| 190 48 |162 39|
|262 62| 213 52| 189 42 |162 40|
|229 52| 213 52| 185 45 |162 40|
|228 52| 206 49|176 42 |158 37|
|224 55| 203 54|174 44 |157 40|
|221 53| 197 58| 174 44| 154 36|

***a. Which of the two variables (height and floors) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?***
>
>- The independent variable is the number of floors, since it is the characteristic that would typically determine or influence the height of the building.
>- The dependent variable is the height, since the height of the building would depend on the number of floors (with each additional floor contributing to the overall height).
>So, height is dependent on the number of floors, while the number of floors can be treated as the independent variable.

***b. Find the correlation coefficient, r. What does this tell you about the strength and direction of the relationship between height and number of floors?***
>
>$S_{xy} = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y}) = 396.85 $
>
>$S_x = 9.49 $
>
>$S_y = 1.85 $

  $r = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_x S_y} = \frac{6.96}{4.14*3.43} = 0.91 $

  $b = r\frac{S_y}{S_x} = 0.91\frac{1.85}{4.14} = 0.41$

  $a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 6.12$
