***How closely is the height (in meters) of a tall building and the number of floors related? The heights of 28 buildings in downtown Los Angeles and the number of floors for each building follows***

|Height Floors| Height Floors| Height Floors| Height Floors|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|335 73| 220 54| 194 49 |163 41|
|310 73| 219 52| 190 48 |162 39|
|262 62| 213 52| 189 42 |162 40|
|229 52| 213 52| 185 45 |162 40|
|228 52| 206 49|176 42 |158 37|
|224 55| 203 54|174 44 |157 40|

***a. Which of the two variables (height and floors) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?***
>
>- The independent variable is the number of floors, since it is the characteristic that would typically determine or influence the height of the building.
>- The dependent variable is the height, since the height of the building would depend on the number of floors (with each additional floor contributing to the overall height).
>So, height is dependent on the number of floors, while the number of floors can be treated as the independent variable.
>
***b. Find the correlation coefficient, r. What does this tell you about the strength and direction of the relationship between height and number of floors?***

>The correlation coefficient is close to 1, indicating a strong positive correlation between the number of floors and the height of the buildings.
>This suggests that as the number of floors increases, the height of the buildings also tends to increase proportionally.

***c. Plot the data using a scatterplot and describe the patern that you see. Are there any outliers?***

$以樓層數帶入最小平方回歸線計算預估樓高(y_{predict})並將實際樓高y與y_predict差異數以z表示(殘差)：$

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0127be19-37b3-430a-abe8-496b87f2d888)

${s_z}^2 = \frac{\sum{z^2}-\frac{{(\sum{z})}^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{4,383.2-\frac{\sum{(5.72)}^2}{28}}{27} = \frac{4,350.4816}{27} \approx 161.1289$

$s_z = \sqrt{161.1289} \approx 12.6937$

$再將殘差標準化(\frac{z}{s_z})，可以發現第14筆樣本之標準化殘差大於3倍，因此判定為outlier$

***d. Find the least-squares line, and use it to predict the height of a building in Los Angeles that has 48 floors.***

<br/>

$b = r \times \frac{s_y}{s_x} = 0.9566 \times \frac{43.7058}{9.4921} = 4.4045$

$a = \bar{y} - b \times \bar{x} = 202.86 - 4.4045 \times 49.21 = (13.8854)$

<br/>

round to two decimal places:

$y = a + b \times x$  

$\Rightarrow y = (13.89) + 4.40x$

<br/>

if a building in Los Angeles has 48 floors, its height might be 197.31 meters:

$(13.89) + 4.40 \times 48 = 197.31$
