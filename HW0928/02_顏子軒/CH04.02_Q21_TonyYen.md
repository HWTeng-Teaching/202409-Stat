***A bowl contains five candies—red, brown, yellow, blue, and orange. Draw two candies at random, one for you to eat, and one for a friend. What is the probability that you get the orange candy and your friend does not get the red one?***

*Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes*

> There are 5 candies: red (R), brown (Br), yellow (Y), blue (Bl), and orange (O).  
> 
> When drawing two candies, one for you and one for your friend, the number of possible outcomes (without considering the order) is determined by the  combination of 5 candies taken 2 at a time: 
>
> Total outcomes = $\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$ 
> 
>  So, there are 10 possible pairs of candies. 

*Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes*

> First, you get the orange candy (O).
For your friend not to get the red candy (R), your friend must get one of the remaining 4 candies, excluding red. The possible choices for your friend are: brown (Br), yellow (Y), or blue (Bl).
> 
> Thus, the possible favorable outcomes are:
> 
> You get O, and your friend gets Br.
> You get O, and your friend gets Y.
> You get O, and your friend gets Bl.
> There are 3 favorable outcomes.

*Step 3: Calculate the probability*

> The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:
> 
> __Thus, the probability is $\frac{3}{10}$, or 0.3(30%)__
