***A bowl contains five candies—red, brown, yellow, blue, and orange. Draw two candies at random, one for you to eat, and one for a friend. What is the probability that you get the orange candy and your friend does not get the red one?***

Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes
There are 5 candies: red (R), brown (Br), yellow (Y), blue (Bl), and orange (O).

When drawing two candies, one for you and one for your friend, the number of possible outcomes (without considering the order) is determined by the combination of 5 candies taken 2 at a time:

Total outcomes = 


Total outcomes=(

 )= 
2×1

​
 =10
So, there are 10 possible pairs of candies.

Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes
We are asked to find the probability that:

You get the orange candy, and
Your friend does not get the red candy.
Let's break it down:

First, you get the orange candy (O).
For your friend not to get the red candy (R), your friend must get one of the remaining 4 candies, excluding red. The possible choices for your friend are: brown (Br), yellow (Y), or blue (Bl).
Thus, the possible favorable outcomes are:

You get O, and your friend gets Br.
You get O, and your friend gets Y.
You get O, and your friend gets Bl.
There are 3 favorable outcomes.

Step 3: Calculate the probability
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:

𝑃
(
You get orange, friend does not get red
)
=
3
10
P(You get orange, friend does not get red)= 
10
