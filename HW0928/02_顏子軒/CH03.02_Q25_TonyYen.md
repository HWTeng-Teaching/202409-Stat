***Chirping Crickets***

***Male crickets chirp by rubbing their front wings together. They chirp faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperatures. The following table shows the number of chirps per second for a cricket, recorded at 10 different temperatures.***

|    ***Event***        |          ***Value***                | 
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
|***Chirps per second***| ***20 16 19 18 18 16 14 17 15 16*** |
|***Temperature***      | ***31 23 33 29 28 24 21 28 21 28*** |

***a. Which of the two variables (temperature and number of chirps) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?***

>- **Independent variable: Temperature**
>- **Dependent variable: Number of chirps per second**
>  
>The temperature is the independent variable because it affects how fast the crickets chirp. The number of chirps per second is the dependent variable because it changes in response to the temperature.

***b. Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relationship between temperature and number of chirps?***

>
>The scatterplot shows a **positive relationship** between temperature and the number of chirps per second. As the temperature increases, the crickets tend to chirp more frequently, though the relationship is not perfectly linear.

***c. Find the least-squares line relating the number of chirps to the temperature.***

>All calculations are rounded to the second decimal places unless otherwise noted.
>
>$S_{xy} = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y}) = 6.96 $
>
>$S_x = 4.14 $
>
>$S_y = 1.85 $
>
>$r = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_x S_y} = \frac{6.96}{4.14*3.43} = 0.91 $
>
>$b = r\frac{S_y}{S_x} = 0.91\frac{1.85}{4.14} = 0.41$
>
>$a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 6.12$
>
>**$y=6.12+0.41x$**
>
***d. If a cricket is monitored at a temperature of 27 degrees, what would you predict his number of chirps would be?***
>
>**$y = 6.12+0.41*27 = 17 (Rounddown)$**
