***Use a tree diagram to find the simple events for the experiments in Exercises 21–24***

***24. A student was asked four “yes” or “no” questions— do you have an account on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.***

For this situation, each question can have two possible answers: "yes" or "no." Since there are four independent questions, the total number of simple events can be found using the rule of product.

The number of possible outcomes is: 2×2×2×2=16
