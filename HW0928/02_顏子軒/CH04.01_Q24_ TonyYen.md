***Use a tree diagram to find the simple events for the experiments in Exercises 21–24***

***24. A student was asked four “yes” or “no” questions— do you have an account on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.***

For this situation, each question can have two possible answers: "yes" or "no." Since there are four independent questions, the total number of simple events can be found using the rule of product.

The number of possible outcomes is: 2×2×2×2=16

Simple events are as follows:

E1 = (Y, Y, Y, Y)  
E2 = (Y, Y, Y, N)  
E3 = (Y, Y, N, Y)  
E4 = (Y, Y, N, N)  
E5 = (Y, N, Y, Y)  
E6 = (Y, N, Y, N)  
E7 = (Y, N, N, Y)  
E8 = (Y, N, N, N)  
E9 = (N, Y, Y, Y)  
E10 = (N, Y, Y, N)  
E11 = (N, Y, N, Y)  
E12 = (N, Y, N, N)  
E13 = (N, N, Y, Y)  
E14 = (N, N, Y, N)  
E15 = (N, N, N, Y)  
E16 = (N, N, N, N)
