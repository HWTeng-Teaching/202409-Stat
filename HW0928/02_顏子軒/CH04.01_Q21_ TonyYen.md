***Use a tree diagram to find the simple events for the experiments in Exercises 21–24.***

***21. A bowl contains five candies—red, brown, yellow, blue, and orange. Draw two candies at random, one for you to eat, and one for a friend.***

Each branch represents a possible outcome where I first draw a candy and then another for my friend. The total number of possible outcomes is 20 since the order of selection matters.
