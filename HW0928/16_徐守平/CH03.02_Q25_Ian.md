a.

Independent Variable: Temperature 

Dependent Variable: Number of chirps


b. 


The crickets chirp between 21 to 33 degree, and frequently while the temperatures has increased.

c. 

Regression lin is y=a+bx , y=5.99+0.41x

$$
a=\bar{y}-{b\bar{x}} =16.9-0.41*26.6 = 5.99
$$

$$
b=r{\frac{S_y}{S_x}} = 0.91{\frac{1.85}{4.14}} = 0.41
$$ 

$$
r={\frac{S_{xy}}{S_x*S_y}} = {\frac{6.96}{{4.14}{*1.85}}} = 0.91
$$

$$
S_{xy}=\frac{\left[\sum{x_i}{y_i}-\frac{(\sum{x_i})(\sum{y_i})}{n}\right]}{n-1}=\frac{\left[4558-\frac{(266)(169)}{10}\right]}{9}=6.96
$$

d.

y=a+bx , y=5.99+0.41x ,y=5.99+0.41*27,y=17.06

Chirp will be at 17 to 18 times.
