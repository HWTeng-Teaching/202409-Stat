### a. Which of the two variables (height and floors) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent varible?

<br/>

Floors is the independent variable.

Height is the dependent variable.

<br/>

### b. Find the correlation coefficient, r. What does this tell you about the strength and direction of the relaionship between height and number of floors?

<br/>

${s_x}^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}-\frac{(\sum{x})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{70,250-\frac{(1,378)^2}{28}}{27} = \frac{70,250 - 67,817.2857}{27} \approx 90.1005$

$s_x = \sqrt{90.1005} \approx 9.4921$

<br/>

${s_y}^2 = \frac{\sum{y^2}-\frac{(\sum{y})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{1,203,804-\frac{(5,680)^2}{28}}{27} = \frac{1,203,804 - 1,152,228.57}{27} \approx 1,910.2011$

$s_y = \sqrt{1,910.2011} \approx 43.7058$

<br/>

$s_{xy} = \frac{\sum{xy}-\frac{\sum{x}\times\sum{y}}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{290,252-\frac{1,378\times5,680}{28}}{27} = \frac{290,252-279,537.1429}{27} \approx 396.8466$

$r = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x \times s_y} = \frac{396.8466}{9.4921 \times 43.7058} \approx 0.9566$

<br/>

The correlation coefficient is close to 1, indicating a strong positive correlation between the number of floors and the height of the buildings. This suggests that as the number of floors increases, the height of the buildings also tends to increase proportionally.

<br/>

### c. Plot the data using a scatterplot and describe the patern that you see. Are there any outliers?

$以樓層數帶入最小平方回歸線計算預估樓高(y_{predict})並將實際樓高y與y_predict差異數以z表示(殘差)：$

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0127be19-37b3-430a-abe8-496b87f2d888)

${s_z}^2 = \frac{\sum{z^2}-\frac{{(\sum{z})}^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac{4,383.2-\frac{\sum{(5.72)}^2}{28}}{27} = \frac{4,350.4816}{27} \approx 161.1289$

$s_z = \sqrt{161.1289} \approx 12.6937$

$再將殘差標準化(\frac{z}{s_z})，可以發現第14筆樣本之標準化殘差大於3倍，因此判定為outlier$

<br/>

### d. Find the least-squares line, and use it to predict the height of a building in Los Angeles that has 48 floors.

<br/>

$b = r \times \frac{s_y}{s_x} = 0.9566 \times \frac{43.7058}{9.4921} = 4.4045$

$a = \bar{y} - b \times \bar{x} = 202.86 - 4.4045 \times 49.21 = (13.8854)$

<br/>

round to two decimal places:

$y = a + b \times x$  

$\Rightarrow y = (13.89) + 4.40x$

<br/>

if a building in Los Angeles has 48 floors, its height might be 197.31 meters:

$(13.89) + 4.40 \times 48 = 197.31$

<br/>
