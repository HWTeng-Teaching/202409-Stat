Favorable Outcomes:

You get the orange candy: After taking the orange candy, only four candies remain: red, brown, yellow, and blue.

Your friend does not get the red candy: This leaves three possible choices for your friend: brown, yellow, or blue.

The favorable outcomes where you get the orange candy and your friend does not get the red candy are:

Orange and Brown

Orange and Yellow

Orange and Blue

Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes.
	
Calculate Probability:

$P(\text{Orange and Not Red})=\frac{1}{5}\times{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{3}{20}$
