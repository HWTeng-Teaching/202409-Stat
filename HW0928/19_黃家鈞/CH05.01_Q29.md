a. 

$p(1)=(1-\frac{1}{10})^{1-1}\times\frac{1}{10}=1\times\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{10}$

$p(2)=(1-\frac{1}{10})^{2-1}\times\frac{1}{10}=\frac{9}{10}\times\frac{1}{10}=\frac{9}{100}$

$p(3)=(1-\frac{1}{10})^{3-1}\times\frac{1}{10}=(\frac{9}{10})^2\times\frac{1}{10}=\frac{81}{1000}$

b.

$p(x)=(1-\frac{1}{10})^{x-1}\times\frac{1}{10}$

c. Graph ￼.

Here is a Markdown code for a text-based description of what the graph would look like:

The graph of \( p(x) \) will show a decreasing probability as \( x \) increases. Each point on the graph decreases exponentially from \( \frac{1}{10} \) at \( x = 1 \), illustrating a clear downward trend.

These representations provide clear and precise mathematical expressions using fractions and Markdown formatting.
