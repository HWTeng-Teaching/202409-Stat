red(R) brown(BR) yellow(Y) blue(B) orange(O)

We can represent the tree diagram as follows:

Start with the five options for the first candy (for you): R, BR, Y, B, O.  
For each of these first options, there are four remaining candies that your friend can choose from.  
If you draw Red (R), the possible choices for your friend are: BR, Y, B, O.  
If you draw Brown (B), the possible choices for your friend are: R, Y, B, O.  
If you draw Yellow (Y), the possible choices for your friend are: R, BR, B, O.  
If you draw Blue (Bl), the possible choices for your friend are: R, BR, Y, O.  
If you draw Orange (O), the possible choices for your friend are: R, BR, Y, B.  
Thus, the total number of combinations is 5Ã—4=20 simple events.
