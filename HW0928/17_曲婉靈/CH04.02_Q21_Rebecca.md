red(R) brown(BR) yellow(Y) blue(B) orange(O)

We can represent the tree diagram as follows:

Start with the five options for the first candy (for you): R, BR, Y, B, O.
For each of these first options, there are four remaining candies that your friend can choose from.
If you draw Red (R), the possible choices for your friend are: BR, Y, B, O.
If you draw Brown (B), the possible choices for your friend are: R, Y, B, O.
If you draw Yellow (Y), the possible choices for your friend are: R, BR, B, O.
If you draw Blue (Bl), the possible choices for your friend are: R, BR, Y, O.
If you draw Orange (O)*, the possible choices for your friend are: R, BR*, Y*, B*.
Thus, the total number of combinations is 5Ã—4=20 simple events.

There are only 3 simple events match the situation of orange candy for me and not red candy for friend.

So the probability is 3/20 = 15%
