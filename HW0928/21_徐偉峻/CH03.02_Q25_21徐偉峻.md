Male crickets chirp faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperatures.

| crips per second | 20 | 16 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 16 | 14 | 17 | 15 | 16 |

a. Which of the two variables (temperature and number of chirps) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?

Sometimes x and y are related in a particular way - the value of y depends on the value of x.

y = dependent variable, Number of chirps per second (because it changes based on the temperature)

x = independent variable, Temperature (because the number of chirps depends on it).


b. Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relationship between temperature and number of chirps?

Based on the scatterplot, the relationship appears to be strong and positive linear. To confirm my observation, I will calculate the covariance to determine whether it is positive or negative, and the correlation coefficient to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.

|7        | 21      | 14      | 294           | 441 | 196 |

| $\sum$  | 266     | 169     | 4,588         | 7,230 | 2,887 |
| Mean    | 26.6    | 16.9    |               |       |       |

The covariance: $S_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n - 1}$

$\sum x_i = 266, \bar x = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} = \frac{266}{10} = 26.6$

$\sum y_i = 169, \bar y = \frac{\sum y_i}{n} = \frac{169}{10} = 16.9$

$\sum x_i y_i = 4,558$

n = number of data points = 10

The covariance equals to

$S_{xy} = \frac{\sum x_i y_i - \frac{(\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n}}{(n - 1)} = \frac{(4,558) - (\frac{(266)(169)}{10})}{(10-1)} = \frac{62.6}{9} = 6.96$

$S_{xy} > 0$ indicates the positive pattern.

The correlation coefficient: the strength and direction of the relationship between x and y are measured using the correlation coefficient, r.

$r = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{x} S_{y}}$

$S_{x}$ = standard deviation of the x’s

$S_{y}$ = standard deviation of the y’s

$\sum x_{i}^2 = (961 + 529 + 1,089 + 841 + 784 + 576 + 441 + 784 + 441 + 784) = 7,230$

$\sum x_{i} = (31 + 23 + 33 + 29 + 28 + 24 + 21 + 28 + 21 + 28) = 266$

$S_{x}^2 = \frac {\sum (x_{i} - \bar {x})^2}{n-1} = \frac {\sum x_{i}^2 - \frac {(\sum x_{i})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac {7,230 - \frac {266}{10}}{10-1} = \frac {7,230 - \frac {70,756}{10}}{9} = \frac {7,230 - 7,075.6}{9} = \frac {154.4}{9} = 17.1556$

$S_{x} = 4.14$

$\sum y_{i}^2 = (400 + 256 + 361 + 324 + 324 + 256 + 196 + 289 + 225 + 256) = 2,887$

$\sum y_{i} = (20 + 16 + 19 + 18 + 18 + 16 + 14 + 17 + 15 + 16) = 169$

$S_{y}^2 = \frac {\sum (y_{i} - \bar {y})^2}{n-1} = \frac {\sum y_{i}^2 - \frac {(\sum y_{i})^2}{n}}{n-1} = \frac {2,887- \frac {28,561}{10}}{10-1} = \frac {2,887 - \frac {28,561}{10}}{9} = \frac {2,887 - 2,856.1}{9} = \frac {30.9}{9} = 3.433$

$S_{y} = 1.85$





c. Find the least-squares line relating the number of chirps to the temperature.

The least-squares line has the form: y = a + bx

Where y is the number of chirps, x is the temperature, a is the y-intercept of the line, and b is slope of the line.

d. If a cricket is monitored at a temperature of 27 degrees, what would you predict his number of chirps would be?
