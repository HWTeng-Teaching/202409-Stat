Male crickets crips  faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperatures.

| crips per second | 20 | 16 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 16 | 14 | 17 | 15 | 16 |
|:----------------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Temperature      | 31 | 23 | 33 | 29 | 28 | 24 | 21 | 28 | 21 | 28 |

a. Which of the two variables (temperature and number of chirps) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?

Sometimes x and y are related in a particular way - the value of y depends on the value of x.

y = dependent variable, Number of chirps per second (because it changes based on the temperature)

x = independent variable, Temperature (because the number of chirps depends on it).


b. Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relationship between temperature and number of chirps?

The covariance: $S_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n - 1}$
