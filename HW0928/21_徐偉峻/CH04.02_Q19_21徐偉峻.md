For the experiments, list the sample events in the sample space, assign probabilities to the simple events, and find the required probabilities.

Three Children are selected, and their gender recorded. Assume that males and females are equally likely. What is the probability that there are two boys and one girl in the group?

| Sample event | First select | Second select | Third select | Probability |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| $E_{1}$      | B	          | B             | B            | P($E_{1}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{2}$      | B	          | B             |	G            | P($E_{2}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{3}$      | B            | G             | B            | P($E_{3}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{4}$      | B            | G             |	G            | P($E_{4}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{5}$      | G            |	B             |	B            | P($E_{5}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{6}$      | G            |	B             |	G            | P($E_{6}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{7}$      | G            | G             | B            | P($E_{7}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| $E_{8}$      | G            | G             | G            | P($E_{8}$) = $\frac{1}{8}$ |

A: two boys and one girl = {$E_{2}$, $E_{3}$, $E_{5}$}

$P(A) = \frac{number of simple events in A}{total number of somple events} = \frac{n_{A}}{N} = \frac{3}{8}$
