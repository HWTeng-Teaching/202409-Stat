The heights of 28 buildings in downtown Los Angeles and the number of floors for each building follows.

a. Which of the two variables (height and floors) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable.

Sometimes x and y are related in a particular way - the value of y depends on the value of x.

y = dependent variable, the height of a tall building (because it changes based on the numebr of floors)

x = independent variable, the number of floors.


b. Find the correlation coefficient, r. What does this tell you anout the strength and direction of the relationship between height and number of floors?

$Covariance = S_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})(y_{i} - \bar{y})}{n-1} = \frac{\sum x_{i} y_{i} - \frac{(\sum x_{i})(\sum y_{i})}{n}}{n-1} = 396.85$

$ r =\frac {S_{xy}}{S_{x} S_{y}}$

$S_{x}$ = standard deviation of x's

$S_{y}$ = standard deviation of y's

$S_{x}^2 = \frac {\sum (x_{i} - \bar {x})^2}{n-1} = \frac {\sum x_{i}^2 - \frac{(\sum x_{i})^2}{n}}{n-1} = 9.49$

$S_{y}^2 = \frac {\sum (y_{i} - \bar {y})^2}{n-1} = \frac {\sum y_{i}^2 - \frac{(\sum y_{i})^2}{n}}{n-1} = 43.71$

$ r =\frac {S_{xy}}{S_{x} S_{y}} = \frac {396.85}{(9.49)(43.71)} = 0.96$

Strong positive, almost perfect


d. Find the least-squares line, and use it to predict the height of a building in Los Angeles that has 48 floors.									

The least-squares line, also known as the regression line

y = a + bx

a = y-tntercept of the line 		

b = slpoe of the line		
		
$b = r \frac {S_{y}}{S_{x}} = 4.4$		
		
$ a =\bar {y} - b\bar {x} = -13.91 $		

y= -13.91 + 4.4x

To predict the height of a building in LA that has 48 floors

y= -13.91 + 4.4x = -13.91 + 4.4*48 = 197.51 

predicted height is 197.51 in meters
