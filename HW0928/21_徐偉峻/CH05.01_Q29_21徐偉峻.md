Drilling Oil Wells.
Based on experience, on the average, only 1 in 10 wells drilled hits oil.
Let x be the number of drillings until the first success (oil is struck) 
Assume thay the drillings represent indenpendent events.

a. Find p(1), p(2), and p(3).

p(1) = 0.1
P(2) = 0.9*0.1 = 0.09
P(3) = 0.9*0.9*0.1= 0.081

b. Give a formula for p(x).

The probability mass function (pmf) = $p(Ｘ＝x) = (1 - p)^{x - 1} p$



c. Graph p(x)
