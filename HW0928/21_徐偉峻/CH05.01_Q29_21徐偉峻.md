Drilling Oil Wells.
Based on experience, on the average, only 1 in 10 wells drilled hits oil.
Let x be the number of drillings until the first success (oil is struck) 
Assume thay the drillings represent indenpendent events.

a. Find p(1), p(2), and p(3).

p(1) = 0.1

P(2) = 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09

P(3) = 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.081

b. Give a formula for p(x).

The probability mass function (pmf) = $p(Ｘ＝x) = (1 - p)^{x - 1} p = 0.9^{x - 1} (0.1) $ 

x = 1, 2, 3 ... 10

Where:

p = 0.1 (the probability of success),

1 − p = 0.9 (the probability of failure),

x is the number of trials until the first success.

c. Graph p(x)
