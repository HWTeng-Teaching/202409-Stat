A key ring contains four office keys that are identical in appearance, but only one will open your office door.							
Suppose you randomly select one key and try it. If it does not fit, you randomly select one of the three remaining keys.							
If that key does not fit, you randomly select one of the last two. Each different sequence that could occur in selecting the keys represents a set of equally likely simple events.							
							
a. List the simple events in S and assign probabilities to the simple events.							
| Simple Event | First Try | Second Try | Third Try | Fourth Try | Probability |
|:------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| E1 | works | NA | NA | NA | $ /frac{1}{4}$ |
| E2 | fails | works | NA | NA |  | $ /frac{1}{4}$ |
| E3 | fials | fails | works | NA | $ /frac{1}{4}$ |
| E4 | fails | fails | fails | works | $ /frac{1}{4}$ |

S = { $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$, $E_{3}$, $E_{4}$ }

b. Let x equal the number of keys that you try before you find the one that opnes the door (x = 1, 2, 3, 4).
Then assign the appropriate value of x to each simple event.



c. Construct a probability histogram for p(x).
