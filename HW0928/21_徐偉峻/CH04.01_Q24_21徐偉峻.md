Use a tree diagram to find the simple events for the experiments.

A student was asked four "yes" or "no" questions-do you have an account on Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram, and Snapchat.


Simple Events:
Each branch of the tree diagram leads to one of the final outcomes, which can be represented as a combination of "Yes" (Y) or "No" (N) for Facebook (FB), X (TW), Instagram (IG), and Snapchat (SC).

The 16 possible outcomes (simple events) are:

(Y, Y, Y, Y) - Yes to all platforms
(Y, Y, Y, N)
(Y, Y, N, Y)
(Y, Y, N, N)
(Y, N, Y, Y)
(Y, N, Y, N)
(Y, N, N, Y)
(Y, N, N, N)
(N, Y, Y, Y)
(N, Y, Y, N)
(N, Y, N, Y)
(N, Y, N, N)
(N, N, Y, Y)
(N, N, Y, N)
(N, N, N, Y)
(N, N, N, N) - No to all platforms
