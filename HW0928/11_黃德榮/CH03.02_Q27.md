a. Which of the two variables (height and floors) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?
independent variable = floors
dependent variable = Height

b. Find the correlation coefficient, r. What does this tell you about the strength and direction of the relationship between height and number of floors?

Sx = 9.49

Sy = 43.71

Sxy = 396.85

r = 0.96 > 0

Strong positive, almost perfect

c. Plot the data using a scatterplot and describe the pattern that you see. Are there any outliers?

It's a positive linear relationship between the two variables.

d. Find the least-squares line, and use it to predict the height of a building in Los Angeles that has 48 floors. The least-squares line, also known as the regression line

b = Sxy/(SxSy)

b = 4.40

a = y-bx = -13.91

least-squares line: y = -13.91 + 4.40x

x = 48 floors

y = 197.29 m
