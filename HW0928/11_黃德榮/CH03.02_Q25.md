a. Which of the two variables (temperature and number of chirps) is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?
independent variable = temperature
dependent variable = Number of chirps per second

b. Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relationship between temperature and number of chirps?

the higher temperature make more number chirps per second.

c. Find the least-squares line relating the number of chirps to the temperature.

d.If a cricket is monitored at a temperature of 27 degrees, what would you predict his number of chirps would be?

y = 0.41 * 27 + 6.12 = 17.19

number of chirps = 17.2
