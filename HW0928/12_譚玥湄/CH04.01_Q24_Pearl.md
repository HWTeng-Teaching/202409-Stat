4.1 Q24 Tree Diagram

Q24. Use a Tree Diagram to find the simple event for A student was asked four 'Yes' or 'No' question . 

Answer:  
Each path through the tree represents a sequence of answers. Since each question has two possible outcomes (Y or N) and there are 4 questions, the total number of possible simple events (or sequences of answers) is 2 * 4 = 16

Simple Events:  
Each branch of the tree represents a sequence of answers, such as:
(Y, Y, Y, Y)
(Y, Y, Y, N)
(Y, Y, N, Y)
(Y, Y, N, N)
...
(N, N, N, N)
There are 16 possible outcomes.
