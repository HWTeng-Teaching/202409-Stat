4.1 Q24 Tree Diagram

Q24. Use a Tree Diagram to find the simple event for A student was asked four 'Yes' or 'No' question . Do you have an account for Facebook , Twitter, Instagram or Snapchapï¼Ÿ

Answer:  
In this case, the student is asked four "Yes" or "No" questions, each corresponding to a different platform: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. For each platform, the student can answer either "Yes" (Y) or "No" (N).

Steps for creating the tree diagram:
- First question: Do you have a Facebook account? (Answer: Yes or No)  
- Second question: Do you have a Twitter account? (Answer: Yes or No)  
- Third question: Do you have an Instagram account? (Answer: Yes or No)  
- Fourth question: Do you have a Snapchat account? (Answer: Yes or No)  
- Each question has two possible outcomes (Y or N), so the tree branches at each level, representing the possible answers.

Number of Simple Events:
Since there are 4 questions, each with 2 possible answers, the total number of possible simple events (or answer combinations) is 
2 * 4 = 16

Simple Events:  
Each branch of the tree represents a sequence of answers, such as:
Each path in the tree diagram corresponds to one possible sequence of answers. These 16 simple events are:

(Y, Y, Y, Y) - Yes to all platforms  
(Y, Y, Y, N)  
(Y, Y, N, Y)  
(Y, Y, N, N)  
(Y, N, Y, Y)  
(Y, N, Y, N)  
(Y, N, N, Y)  
(Y, N, N, N)  
(N, Y, Y, Y)  
(N, Y, Y, N)  
(N, Y, N, Y)  
(N, Y, N, N)  
(N, N, Y, Y)  
(N, N, Y, N)  
(N, N, N, Y)  
(N, N, N, N) - No to all platforms
