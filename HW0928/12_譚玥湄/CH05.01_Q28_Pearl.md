5.1 Apply the Basic.

Q28. Which Key Fit 
a. List the simple event in S and assign probabilities to the simple events.  
Answer:  

The simple events are:  
(K1,K2,K3,K4)  
(K1,K2,K4,K3)  
(K1,K3,K2,K4)  
.........  
(K4,K3,K2,K1)
These are the 24 simple events corresponding to the 4! = 24 possible sequences.  

b. Let x equal the number of Keys that you try before yo find the one that opens the door (x=1,2,3,4). Then assign the appropriate value of x to each simple event.

Answer:  
|x| Simple Event in x | 
| :---|:---:|
|1 |   E1  | 
|2 |   E2  | 
|3 |   E3  | 
|4 |   E4   |  

  
c. calculate p(x) and display them in a table 
Answer:  
|x| Simple Event in x | P(x) |
| :---|:---:|:---:|
|1 |  E1  |  1/4  |
|2 |  E2  |  1/4 = 4/3 * 2/3  |
|3 |  E3  |  1/4 = 4/3 * 1/3 * 2/1 |
|4 |  E4  |  1/4 = 4/3 * 1/3 * 2/1 * 1 |

d.construct a probability histogram for p(x)
Answer:
