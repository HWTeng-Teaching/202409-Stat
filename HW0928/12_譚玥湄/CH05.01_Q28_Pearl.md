5.1 Apply the Basic.

Q28. Which Key Fit 
a. List the simple event in S and assign probabilities to the simple events.  
Answer: 
E1 : 1st key to open the door (s)
E2 : 2nd key to open the door (f,s)
E3 : 3rd key to open the door (f,f,s)
E4 : 4th key to open the door (f,f,f,s)

|Simple Event| P(E) |
| :---|:---:|
|E1 |   1/10 = 0.1  |
|E2 |   2/10 = 0.2  |
|E3 |   3/10 = 0.3  |
|E4 |   4/10 = 0.4  |

b. Let x equal the number of Keys that you try before yo find the one that opens the door (x=1,2,3,4). Then assign the appropriate value of x to each simple event.
Answer:  
|x| Simple Event in x | 
| :---|:---:|
|1 |   E1  | 
|2 |   E2  | 
|3 |   E3  | 
|4 |   E4   |  

  
c. calculate p(x) and display them in a table 
Answer:  
|x| Simple Event in x | P(x) |
| :---|:---:|:---:|
|1 |  E1  |  1/4  |
|2 |  E2  |  1/4  |
|3 |  E3  |  1/4  |
|4 |  E4  |  1/4  |

d.construct a probability histogram for p(x)
