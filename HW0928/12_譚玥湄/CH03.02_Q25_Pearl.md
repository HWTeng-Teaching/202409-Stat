#a.Which the of two variables(temperature and number of chirps) in the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?  
[temperature,number of chirps] = [(31, 20), (23, 16), (33, 19), (29, 18), (28, 18), (24, 16), (21, 14), (28, 17), (21, 15), (28, 16)]
        
Answer :  
The two variables : x and y , x explains y or y depends on x , x is the explanatory or independent variables , y is the reponse or depdendent variable.  
##temperature(x) is independent variable  
##number of chirps(y) is  dependent variable

#b.Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relatioship between temperature and number of chirps of chirps ?   
Answer :  
Scatter Plot是統計學很常使用的圖形之一,可用來觀察兩個variables之間的關係,進行variables間correlation程度的探討或 在進行regression analysis前,通常也會先繪製Scatter Plot來瞭解兩個variable間關係的變化.  

The relatioship between temperature and number of chirps of chirps is 'Positive Linear'

#c.Find the least-squares line relating the number of chirps to the temperature ?
Answer:  y = a + bx  

- n=10
- $\{\sum(x_i^2)=4558}$
- $\{(\sum(x_i))^2=70756}$
- $\{\sum(y_i^2)=7230}$
- $\{(\sum(y_i))^2=28561}$
- $\{\sum(x_i*y_i)=4558}$
- $$Sx=\frac{[\sum(x_i^2)-(\sum x_i)^2/(n)]}{n-1}=4.141$$  
- $$Sy=\frac{[\sum(y_i^2)-(\sum y_i)^2/(n)]}{n-1}=1.852$$  
- $$Sxy=\frac{[\sum(x_i y_i)-(\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)/(n)]}{n-1}=6.955$$
- $$r=\frac{Sxy}{Sx * Sy}=0.9068$$
- $$b=r(Sy/Sx)=0.4056$$
- $$a=\bar{y}-b* \bar{x}$$ = 6.127
  
**The least-squares is y = 6.127 + 0.4056x**  

#d.If a cricket is monitored at a tempature of 27 degress, what would you prediet his number of chirps would be ？
Answer :  
y = 6.127 + 0.4056x
17.002  = 6.127 + 0.4056 * 27

It's approximaitely 17 chirps
