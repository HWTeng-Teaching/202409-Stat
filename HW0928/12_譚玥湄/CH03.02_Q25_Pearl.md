#a.Which the of two variables(temperature and number of chirps) in the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?  
Answer :  
The two variables : x and y , x explains y or y depends on x , x is the explanatory or independent variables , y is the reponse or depdendent variable.  
##temperature(x) is independent variable  
##number of chirps(y) is  dependent variable

#b.Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relatioship between temperature and number of chirps of chirps ?   
Answer :  
Scatter Plot是統計學很常使用的圖形之一,可用來觀察兩個variables之間的關係,進行variables間correlation程度的探討或 在進行regression analysis前,通常也會先繪製Scatter Plot來瞭解兩個variable間關係的變化.  

The relatioship between temperature and number of chirps of chirps is 'Positive Linear'

#c.Find the least-squares line relating the number of chirps to the temperature ?
Answer :  
y = ab + x 



#d.If a cricket is monitored at a tempature of 27 degress, what would you prediet his number of chirps would be ？
Answer :  
y = 5.953 + 0.405x  
16.888  = 5.953 + 0.405 * 27

It's approximaitely 17 chirps
