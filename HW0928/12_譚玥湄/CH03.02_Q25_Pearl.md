#a.Which the of two variables(temperature and number of chirps) in the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?  
Answer :  
The two variables : x and y , x explains y or y depends on x , x is the explanatory or independent variables , y is the reponse or depdendent variable.
##temperature is independent variable  
##number of chirps is dependent variable

#b.Plot the data using a scatterplot. How would you describe the relatioship etween temperature and number of chirps of chips ?   
Answer :  
Scatter Plot是統計學很常使用的圖形之一,可用來觀察兩個variables之間的關係,進行variables間correlation程度的探討或 在進行regression analysis前,通常也會先繪製Scatter Plot來瞭解兩個variable間關係的變化.
