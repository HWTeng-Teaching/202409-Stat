Question:  
Past experience has shown that, on the average, only 1 in 10 wells drilled hits oil.   
Let x be the number of drillings until the first success (oil is struck).   
Assume that the drillings represent independent events.  
a. Find p(1), p(2), and p(3).  
b. Give a formula for p(x).  
c. Graph p(x).  
Solution:  
This problem can be modeled using a geometric distribution.  
Because:  

S	P  
FS	(1-P)P  
FFS	$(1-P)^2P$  

In a geometric distribution, the probability of success on the k-th trial   
(where k is the number of trials until the first success) is given by:  
$P(X=k)=(1-p)^{(k-1)}p$  
Where:

	•	p is the probability of success (hitting oil) on any given trial.
	•	1 - p is the probability of failure (not hitting oil) on a trial.
	•	k is the number of trials until the first success.

Given:

	•	The probability of hitting oil on any single drilling is p = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1.
	•	The probability of failure on any drilling is 1 - p = 0.9.

a. Find P(1), P(2), and P(3)

Using the formula for the geometric distribution:


P(X = k) = (0.9)^{k-1} (0.1)


	•	P(1) = (0.9)^{1-1} (0.1) = (0.9)^0 (0.1) = 0.1
	•	P(2) = (0.9)^{2-1} (0.1) = (0.9)^1 (0.1) = 0.09
	•	P(3) = (0.9)^{3-1} (0.1) = (0.9)^2 (0.1) = 0.081

So:

	•	P(1) = 0.1
	•	P(2) = 0.09
	•	P(3) = 0.081
b. Formula for P(x)

The general formula for the probability that the first success (striking oil) 
occurs on the x-th drilling is:

P(X = x) = (0.9)^{x-1} (0.1)

c. Graph P(x)
