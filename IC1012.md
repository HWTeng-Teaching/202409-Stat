1. A marksman hits a target 80% of the
time. He fires five shots at the target. Let $X$ denote the of shots hit the target. 

a) What is the probability that exactly 3 shots hit the target?
b) What is the distribution of $X$?
c) Write down the probability mass function of $X$. 
d) Find the $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ of $X$. 
e) Calculate $P(X<2)$ =
